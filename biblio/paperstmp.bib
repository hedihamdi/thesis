journal = {Dev Cell},
title = {Genomic regulatory networks and animal development},
abstract = {The synthesis of gene expression data and cis-regulatory analysis permits the elucidation of genomic regulatory networks. These networks provide a direct visualization of the functional interconnections among the regulatory genes and signaling components leading to cell-specific patterns of gene activity. Complex developmental processes are thereby illuminated in ways not revealed by the conventional analysis of individual genes. In this review, we describe emerging networks in several different model systems, and compare them with the gene regulatory network that controls dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo.},
