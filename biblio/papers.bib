title = {Design of genetic networks with specified functions by evolution in silico},
abstract = {Recent studies have provided insights into the modular structure of genetic regulatory networks and emphasized the interest of quantitative functional descriptions. Here, to provide a priori knowledge of the structure of functional modules, we describe an evolutionary procedure in silico that creates small gene networks performing basic tasks. We used it to create networks functioning as bistable switches or oscillators. The obtained circuits provide a variety of functional designs, demonstrate the crucial role of posttranscriptional interactions, and highlight design principles also found in known biological networks. The procedure should prove helpful as a way to understand and create small functional modules with diverse functions as well as to analyze large networks.},

title = {Global transcriptional regulation of the locus encoding the skeletal muscle determination genes Mrf4 and Myf5},
abstract = {The linked Mrf4 and Myf5 genes encode two transcription factors essential for the determination and differentiation of skeletal muscle in the embryo. The locus is controlled by a multitude of interdigitated enhancers that activate gene expression at different times and in precisely defined progenitor cell populations. Manipulation of the enhancer-promoter composition of the locus reveals a novel mechanism for the regulation of such a gene cluster. Enhancers, promoters, and a new class of elements we call transcription balancing sequences, which can act as cryptic promoters, exist in a series of equilibria to ensure that enhancers and promoters together produce the highly dynamic and exquisitely specific expression patterns of the two genes. The proposed model depends upon nonproductive interactions between enhancers and both minimal and cryptic promoters, and is distinct from those developed for the beta-globin and Hox clusters. Moreover, it provides an explanation for the unexpected phenotypes of the three Mrf4 knockout alleles.},

journal = {arXiv},
title = {Quantum Causal Networks},
abstract = {Intervention theories of causality define a relationship as causal if appropriately specified interventions to manipulate a putative cause tend to produce changes in the putative effect. Interventionist causal theories are commonly formalized by using directed graphs to represent causal relationships, local probability models to quantify the relationship between cause and effect, and a special kind of conditioning operator to represent the effects of interventions. Such a formal model represents a family of joint probability distributions, one for each allowable intervention policy. This paper interprets the von Neumann formalization of quantum theory as an interventionist theory of causality, describes its relationship to interventionist theories popular in the artificial intelligence literature, and presents a new family of graphical models that extends causal Bayesian networks to quantum systems.},

abstract = {The small intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing tissue of mammals. Proliferative cells are confined to crypts, while differentiated cell types predominantly occupy the villi. We recently demonstrated the existence of a long-lived pool of cycling stem cells defined by Lgr5 expression and intermingled with post-mitotic Paneth cells at crypt bottoms. We have now determined a gene signature for these Lgr5 stem cells. One of the genes within this stem cell signature is the Wnt target Achaete scute-like 2 (Ascl2). Transgenic expression of the Ascl2 transcription factor throughout the intestinal epithelium induces crypt hyperplasia and ectopic crypts on villi. Induced deletion of the Ascl2 gene in adult small intestine leads to disappearance of the Lgr5 stem cells within days. The combined results from these gain- and loss-of-function experiments imply that Ascl2 controls intestinal stem cell fate.},

title = {Which fine-tuning arguments are fine?},
abstract = {The argument from naturalness is widely employed in contemporary quantum field theory. Essentially a formalized aesthetic criterion, it received a meaning in the debate on the Higgs mechanism, which goes beyond aesthetics. We follow the history of technical definitions of fine tuning at the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking. It is argued that they give rise to a special interpretation of probability, which we call Gedankenfrequency. By extension of its original meaning, the argument from naturalness is used to compare different models beyond the Standard Model. We show that in this case naturalness cannot be defined objectively. Rather, it functions as socio-historical heuristics in particle physics and it contributes to the advent of a probabilistic version of Popper's falsificationism.},

title = {Precise physical models of protein-DNA interaction from high-throughput data},
abstract = {A cell's ability to regulate gene transcription depends in large part on the energy with which transcription factors (TFs) bind their DNA regulatory sites. Obtaining accurate models of this binding energy is therefore an important goal for quantitative biology. In this article, we present a principled likelihood-based approach for inferring physical models of TF-DNA binding energy from the data produced by modern high-throughput binding assays. Central to our analysis is the ability to assess the relative likelihood of different model parameters given experimental observations. We take a unique approach to this problem and show how to compute likelihood without any explicit assumptions about the noise that inevitably corrupts such measurements. Sampling possible choices for model parameters according to this likelihood function, we can then make probabilistic predictions for the identities of binding sites and their physical binding energies. Applying this procedure to previously published data on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TF Abf1p, we find models of TF binding whose parameters are determined with remarkable precision. Evidence for the accuracy of these models is provided by an astonishing level of phylogenetic conservation in the predicted energies of putative binding sites. Results from in vivo and in vitro experiments also provide highly consistent characterizations of Abf1p, a result that contrasts with a previous analysis of the same data.},

abstract = {Retinal ganglion cells that respond selectively to a dark spot on a brighter background (OFF cells) have smaller dendritic fields than their ON counterparts and are more numerous. OFF cells also branch more densely, and thus collect more synapses per visual angle. That the retina devotes more resources to processing dark contrasts predicts that natural images contain more dark information. We confirm this across a range of spatial scales and trace the origin of this phenomenon to the statistical structure of natural scenes. We show that the optimal mosaics for encoding natural images are also asymmetric, with OFF elements smaller and more numerous, matching retinal structure. Finally, the concentration of synapses within a dendritic field matches the information content, suggesting a simple principle to connect a concrete fact of neuroanatomy with the abstract concept of information: equal synapses for equal bits.},

title = {Maximum entropy models for antibody diversity},
abstract = {Recognition of pathogens relies on families of proteins showing great diversity. Here we construct maximum entropy models of the sequence repertoire, building on recent experiments that provide a nearly exhaustive sampling of the IgM sequences in zebrafish. These models are based solely on pairwise correlations between residue positions but correctly capture the higher order statistical properties of the repertoire. By exploiting the interpretation of these models as statistical physics problems, we make several predictions for the collective properties of the sequence ensemble: The distribution of sequences obeys Zipf's law, the repertoire decomposes into several clusters, and there is a massive restriction of diversity because of the correlations. These predictions are completely inconsistent with models in which amino acid substitutions are made independently at each site and are in good agreement with the data. Our results suggest that antibody diversity is not limited by the sequences encoded in the genome and may reflect rapid adaptation to antigenic challenges. This approach should be applicable to the study of the global properties of other protein families.},

title = {Alu elements contain many binding sites for transcription factors and may play a role in regulation of developmental processes},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human genome contains over one million Alu repeat elements whose distribution is not uniform. While metabolism-related genes were shown to be enriched with Alu, in structural genes Alu elements are under-represented. Such observations led researchers to suggest that Alu elements were involved in gene regulation and were selected to be present in some genes and absent from others. This hypothesis is gaining strength due to findings that indicate involvement of Alu elements in a variety of functions; for example, Alu sequences were found to contain several functional transcription factor (TF) binding sites (BSs). We performed a search for new putative BSs on Alu elements, using a database of Position Specific Score Matrices (PSSMs). We searched consensus Alu sequences as well as specific Alu elements that appear on the 5 Kbp regions upstream to the transcription start site (TSS) of about 14000 genes. RESULTS: We found that the upstream regions of the TSS are enriched with Alu elements, and the Alu consensus sequences contain dozens of putative BSs for TFs. Hence several TFs have Alu-associated BSs upstream of the TSS of many genes. For several TFs most of the putative BSs reside on Alu; a few of these were previously found and their association with Alu was also reported. In four cases the fact that the identified BSs resided on Alu went unnoticed, and we report this association for the first time. We found dozens of new putative BSs. Interestingly, many of the corresponding TFs are associated with early markers of development, even though the upstream regions of development-related genes are Alu-poor, compared with translational and protein biosynthesis related genes, which are Alu-rich. Finally, we found a correlation between the mouse B1 and human Alu densities within the corresponding upstream regions of orthologous genes. CONCLUSION: We propose that evolution used transposable elements to insert TF binding motifs into promoter regions. We observed enrichment of biosynthesis genes with Alu-associated BSs of developmental TFs. Since development and cell proliferation (of which biosynthesis is an essential component) were proposed to be opposing processes, these TFs possibly play inhibitory roles, suppressing proliferation during differentiation.},

abstract = {Genetic regulatory networks enable cells to respond to the changes in internal and external conditions by dynamically coordinating their gene expression profiles. Our ability to make quantitative measurements in these biochemical circuits has deepened our understanding of what kinds of computations genetic regulatory networks can perform and with what reliability. These advances have motivated researchers to look for connections between the architecture and function of genetic regulatory networks. Transmitting information between network's inputs and its outputs has been proposed as one such possible measure of function, relevant in certain biological contexts. Here we summarize recent developments in the application of information theory to gene regulatory networks. We first review basic concepts in information theory necessary to understand recent work. We then discuss the functional complexity of gene regulation which arrises from the molecular nature of the regulatory interactions. We end by reviewing some experiments supporting the view that genetic networks responsible for early development of multicellular organisms might be maximizing transmitted 'positional' information.},

abstract = {The heterogeneity and instability of human tumors hamper straightforward identification of cancer-causing mutations through genomic approaches alone. Herein we describe a mouse model of liver cancer initiated from progenitor cells harboring defined cancer-predisposing lesions. Genome-wide analyses of tumors in this mouse model and in human hepatocellular carcinomas revealed a recurrent amplification at mouse chromosome 9qA1, the syntenic region of human chromosome 11q22. Gene-expression analyses delineated cIAP1, a known inhibitor of apoptosis, and Yap, a transcription factor, as candidate oncogenes in the amplicon. In the genetic context of their amplification, both cIAP1 and Yap accelerated tumorigenesis and were required to sustain rapid growth of amplicon-containing tumors. Furthermore, cIAP1 and Yap cooperated to promote tumorigenesis. Our results establish a tractable model of liver cancer, identify two oncogenes that cooperate by virtue of their coamplification in the same genomic locus, and suggest an efficient strategy for the annotation of human cancer genes.},

In particular, synthetic sick or lethal (SSL) genetic interactions are important for understanding how an organism tolerates random mutation, i.e., genetic robustness. Comprehensive identification of SSL relationships remains far from complete in any organism, because mapping these networks is highly labor intensive. The ability to predict SSL interactions, however, could efficiently guide further SSL discovery. Toward this end, we predicted pairs of SSL genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using probabilistic decision trees to integrate multiple types of data, including localization, mRNA expression, physical interaction, protein function, and characteristics of network topology. Experimental evidence demonstrated the reliability of this strategy, which, when extended to human SSL interactions, may prove valuable in discovering drug targets for cancer therapy and in identifying genes responsible for multigenic diseases.},

title = {From principal component to direct coupling analysis of coevolution in proteins: Low-eigenvalue modes are needed for structure prediction},
abstract = {Various approaches have explored the covariation of residues in multiple-sequence alignments of homologous proteins to extract functional and structural information. Among those are principal component analysis (PCA), which identifies the most correlated groups of residues, and direct coupling analysis (DCA), a global inference method based on the maximum entropy principle, which aims at predicting residue-residue contacts. In this paper, inspired by the statistical physics of disordered systems, we introduce the Hopfield-Potts model to naturally interpolate between these two approaches. The Hopfield-Potts model allows us to identify relevant 'patterns' of residues from the knowledge of the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the residue-residue Pearson correlation matrix. We show how the computation of such statistical patterns makes it possible to accurately predict residue-residue contacts with a much smaller number of parameters than DCA. In addition, we show that low-eigenvalue correlation modes, discarded by PCA, are important to recover structural information: the corresponding patterns are highly localized, that is, they are concentrated in few sites, which we find to be in close contact on the three-dimensional protein fold. We also explain why these low-eigenvalue modes, in contrast to the standard principal components, are able to efficiently encode compensatory mutations between pairs of residues.},

title = {Geometry, epistasis, and developmental patterning},
abstract = {Developmental signaling networks are composed of dozens of components whose interactions are very difficult to quantify in an embryo. Geometric reasoning enumerates a discrete hierarchy of phenotypic models with a few composite variables whose parameters may be defined by in vivo data. Vulval development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a classic model for the integration of two signaling pathways; induction by EGF and lateral signaling through Notch. Existing data for the relative probabilities of the three possible terminal cell types in diverse genetic backgrounds as well as timed ablation of the inductive signal favor one geometric model and suffice to fit most of its parameters. The model is fully dynamic and encompasses both signaling and commitment. It then predicts the correlated cell fate probabilities for a cross between any two backgrounds/conditions. The two signaling pathways are combined additively, without interactions, and epistasis only arises from the nonlinear dynamical flow in the landscape defined by the geometric model. In this way, the model quantitatively fits genetic experiments purporting to show mutual pathway repression. The model quantifies the contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic sources of noise in the penetrance of mutant phenotypes in signaling hypomorphs and explains available experiments with no additional parameters. Data for anchor cell ablation fix the parameters needed to define Notch autocrine signaling.},

title = {Mechanisms of noise-resistance in genetic oscillators},
abstract = {A wide range of organisms use circadian clocks to keep internal sense of daily time and regulate their behavior accordingly. Most of these clocks use intracellular genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory elements. The integration of these "circuits" at the cellular level imposes strong constraints on their functioning and design. Here, we study a recently proposed model [Barkai, N. {\&} Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London), 403, 267-268] that incorporates just the essential elements found experimentally. We show that this type of oscillator is driven mainly by two elements: the concentration of a repressor protein and the dynamics of an activator protein forming an inactive complex with the repressor. Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA molecules goes below one. Under some conditions, this oscillator is not only resistant to but, paradoxically, also enhanced by the intrinsic biochemical noise.},

abstract = {We present stochastic, finite-population formulations of the Crow-Kimura and Eigen models of quasispecies theory, for fitness functions that depend in an arbitrary way on the number of mutations from the wild type. We include back mutations in our description. We show that the fluctuation of the population numbers about the average values are exceedingly large in these physical models of evolution. We further show that horizontal gene transfer reduces by orders of magnitude the fluctuations in the population numbers and reduces the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the finite population due to Muller's ratchet. Indeed the population sizes needed to converge to the infinite population limit are often larger than those found in nature for smooth fitness functions in the absence of horizontal gene transfer. These analytical results are derived for the steady-state by means of a field-theoretic representation. Numerical results are presented that indicate horizontal gene transfer speeds up the dynamics of evolution as well.},

title = {Indel evolution of mammalian introns and the utility of non-coding nuclear markers in eutherian phylogenetics},
abstract = {Nuclear DNA intron sequences are increasingly used to investigate evolutionary relationships among closely related organisms. The phylogenetic usefulness of intron sequences at higher taxonomic levels has, however, not been firmly established and very few studies have used these markers to address evolutionary questions above the family level. In addition, the mechanisms driving intron evolution are not well understood. We compared DNA sequence data derived from three presumably independently segregating introns (THY, PRKC I and MGF) across 158 mammalian species. All currently recognized extant eutherian mammalian orders were included with the exception of Cingulata, Dermoptera and Scandentia. The total aligned length of the data was 6366 base pairs (bp); after the exclusion of autapomorphic insertions, 1511 bp were analyzed. In many instances the Bayesian and parsimony analyses were complementary and gave significant posterior probability and bootstrap support (>80) for the monophyly of Afrotheria, Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria and Boreoeutheria. Apart from finding congruent support when using these methods, the intron data also provided several indels longer than 3 bp that support, among others, the monophyly of Afrotheria, Paenungulata, Ferae and Boreoeutheria. A quantitative analysis of insertions and deletions suggested that there was a 75% bias towards deletions. The average insertion size in the mammalian data set was 16.49 bp +/- 57.70 while the average deletion was much smaller (4.47 bp +/- 14.17). The tendency towards large insertions and small deletions is highlighted by the observation that out of a total of 17 indels larger than 100 bp, 15 were insertions. The majority of indels (>60% of all events) were 1 or 2 bp changes. Although the average overall indel substitution rate of 0.00559 per site is comparable to that previously reported for rodents and primates, individual analyses among different evolutionary lineages provide evidence for differences in the formation rate of indels among the different mammalian groups.},

title = {Optimizing information flow in small genetic networks. III. A self-interacting gene},
abstract = {Living cells must control the reading out or "expression" of information encoded in their genomes, and this regulation often is mediated by transcription factors-proteins that bind to DNA and either enhance or repress the expression of nearby genes. But the expression of transcription factor proteins is itself regulated, and many transcription factors regulate their own expression in addition to responding to other input signals. Here we analyze the simplest of such self-regulatory circuits, asking how parameters can be chosen to optimize information transmission from inputs to outputs in the steady state. Some nonzero level of self-regulation is almost always optimal, with self-activation dominant when transcription factor concentrations are low and self-repression dominant when concentrations are high. In steady state the optimal self-activation is never strong enough to induce bistability, although there is a limit in which the optimal parameters are very close to the critical point.},

title = {Progenitors of skeletal muscle satellite cells express the muscle determination gene, MyoD},
abstract = {Satellite cells are tissue-specific stem cells responsible for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Although satellite cells were identified almost 50 years ago, the identity of progenitor populations from which they derive remains controversial. We developed MyoD(iCre) knockin mice, and used Cre/lox lineage analysis to determine whether satellite cell progenitors express MyoD, a marker of myogenic commitment. Recombination status of satellite cells was determined by confocal microscopy of isolated muscle fibers and by electron microscopic observation of muscle tissue fixed immediately following isolation, using R26R-EYFP and R26R (beta-gal) reporter mice, respectively. We show that essentially all adult satellite cells associated with limb and body wall musculature, as well as the diaphragm and extraocular muscles, originate from MyoD+ progenitors. Neonatal satellite cells were Cre-recombined, but only a small minority exhibited ongoing Cre expression, indicating that most satellite cells had expressed MyoD prenatally. We also show that satellite cell development in MyoD-null mice is not due to functional compensation by MyoD non-expressing lineages. The results suggest that satellite cells are derived from committed myogenic progenitors, irrespective of the anatomical location, embryological origin, or physiological properties of associated musculature.},

title = {The regulation of Notch signaling in muscle stem cell activation and postnatal myogenesis},
abstract = {The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that is critical for tissue morphogenesis during development, but is also involved in tissue maintenance and repair in the adult. In skeletal muscle, regulation of Notch signaling is involved in somitogenesis, muscle development, and the proliferation and cell fate determination of muscle stems cells during regeneration. During each of these processes, the spatial and temporal control of Notch signaling is essential for proper tissue formation. That control is mediated by a series of regulatory proteins and protein complexes that enhance or inhibit Notch signaling by regulating protein processing, localization, activity, and stability. In this review, we focus on the regulation of Notch signaling during postnatal muscle regeneration when muscle stem cells ("satellite cells") must activate, proliferate, progress along a myogenic lineage pathway, and ultimately differentiate to form new muscle. We review the regulators of Notch signaling, such as Numb and Deltex, that have documented roles in myogenesis as well as other regulators that may play a role in modulating Notch signaling during satellite cell activation and postnatal myogenesis.},

abstract = {We analyzed Pax-3 (splotch), Myf-5 (targeted with nlacZ), and splotch/Myf-5 homozygous mutant mice to investigate the roles that these genes play in programming skeletal myogenesis. In splotch and Myf-5 homozygous embryos, myogenic progenitor cell perturbations and early muscle defects are distinct. Remarkably, splotch/Myf-5 double homozygotes have a dramatic phenotype not seen in the individual mutants: body muscles are absent. MyoD does not rescue this double mutant phenotype since activation of this gene proves to be dependent on either Pax-3 or Myf-5. Therefore, Pax-3 and Myf-5 define two distinct myogenic pathways, and MyoD acts genetically downstream of these genes for myogenesis in the body. This genetic hierarchy does not appear to operate for head muscle formation.},

title = {Migration of cells in a social context},
abstract = {In multicellular organisms and complex ecosystems, cells migrate in a social context. Whereas this is essential for the basic processes of life, the influence of neighboring cells on the individual remains poorly understood. Previous work on isolated cells has observed a stereotypical migratory behavior characterized by short-time directional persistence with long-time random movement. We discovered a much richer dynamic in the social context, with significant variations in directionality, displacement, and speed, which are all modulated by local cell density. We developed a mathematical model based on the experimentally identified "cellular traffic rules" and basic physics that revealed that these emergent behaviors are caused by the interplay of single-cell properties and intercellular interactions, the latter being dominated by a pseudopod formation bias mediated by secreted chemicals and pseudopod collapse following collisions. The model demonstrates how aspects of complex biology can be explained by simple rules of physics and constitutes a rapid test bed for future studies of collective migration of individual cells.},

abstract = {Mammalian genomes are populated with thousands of transcriptional enhancers that orchestrate cell-type-specific gene expression programs, but how those enhancers are exploited to institute alternative, signal-dependent transcriptional responses remains poorly understood. Here we present evidence that cell-lineage-specific factors, such as FoxA1, can simultaneously facilitate and restrict key regulated transcription factors, exemplified by the androgen receptor (AR), to act on structurally and functionally distinct classes of enhancer. Consequently, FoxA1 downregulation, an unfavourable prognostic sign in certain advanced prostate tumours, triggers dramatic reprogramming of the hormonal response by causing a massive switch in AR binding to a distinct cohort of pre-established enhancers. These enhancers are functional, as evidenced by the production of enhancer-templated non-coding RNA (eRNA) based on global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) analysis, with a unique class apparently requiring no nucleosome remodelling to induce specific enhancer-promoter looping and gene activation. GRO-seq data also suggest that liganded AR induces both transcription initiation and elongation. Together, these findings reveal a large repository of active enhancers that can be dynamically tuned to elicit alternative gene expression programs, which may underlie many sequential gene expression events in development, cell differentiation and disease progression.},

title = {Inferring binding energies from selected binding sites},
abstract = {We employ a biophysical model that accounts for the non-linear relationship between binding energy and the statistics of selected binding sites. The model includes the chemical potential of the transcription factor, non-specific binding affinity of the protein for DNA, as well as sequence-specific parameters that may include non-independent contributions of bases to the interaction. We obtain maximum likelihood estimates for all of the parameters and compare the results to standard probabilistic methods of parameter estimation. On simulated data, where the true energy model is known and samples are generated with a variety of parameter values, we show that our method returns much more accurate estimates of the true parameters and much better predictions of the selected binding site distributions. We also introduce a new high-throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX) procedure to determine the binding specificity of a transcription factor in which the initial randomized library and the selected sites are sequenced with next generation methods that return hundreds of thousands of sites. We show that after a single round of selection our method can estimate binding parameters that give very good fits to the selected site distributions, much better than standard motif identification algorithms.},

title = {A functional role for transposases in a large eukaryotic genome},
abstract = {Despite comprising much of the eukaryotic genome, few transposons are active, and they usually confer no benefit to the host. Through an exaggerated process of genome rearrangement, Oxytricha trifallax destroys 95% of its germline genome during development. This includes the elimination of all transposon DNA. We show that germline-limited transposase genes play key roles in this process of genome-wide DNA excision, which suggests that transposases function in large eukaryotic genomes containing thousands of active transposons. We show that transposase gene expression occurs during germline-soma differentiation and that silencing of transposase by RNA interference leads to abnormal DNA rearrangement in the offspring. This study suggests a new important role in Oxytricha for this large portion of genomic DNA that was previously thought of as junk.},

title = {Alignment and prediction of cis-regulatory modules based on a probabilistic model of evolution},
abstract = {Cross-species comparison has emerged as a powerful paradigm for predicting cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and understanding their evolution. The comparison requires reliable sequence alignment, which remains a challenging task for less conserved noncoding sequences. Furthermore, the existing models of DNA sequence evolution generally do not explicitly treat the special properties of CRM sequences. To address these limitations, we propose a model of CRM evolution that captures different modes of evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and the background sequences. A particularly novel aspect of our work is a probabilistic model of gains and losses of TFBSs, a process being recognized as an important part of regulatory sequence evolution. We present a computational framework that uses this model to solve the problems of CRM alignment and prediction. Our alignment method is similar to existing methods of statistical alignment but uses the conserved binding sites to improve alignment. Our CRM prediction method deals with the inherent uncertainties of binding site annotations and sequence alignment in a probabilistic framework. In simulated as well as real data, we demonstrate that our program is able to improve both alignment and prediction of CRM sequences over several state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we used alignments produced by our program to study binding site conservation in genome-wide binding data of key transcription factors in the Drosophila blastoderm, with two intriguing results: (i) the factor-bound sequences are under strong evolutionary constraints even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm and (ii) binding sites in distal bound sequences (relative to transcription start sites) tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions. Our approach is implemented as software, EMMA (Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis), ready to be applied in a broad biological context.},

title = {Improved accuracy of supervised CRM discovery with interpolated Markov models and cross-species comparison},
abstract = {Despite recent advances in experimental approaches for identifying transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs, 'enhancers'), direct empirical discovery of CRMs for all genes in all cell types and environmental conditions is likely to remain an elusive goal. Effective methods for computational CRM discovery are thus a critically needed complement to empirical approaches. However, existing computational methods that search for clusters of putative binding sites are ineffective if the relevant TFs and/or their binding specificities are unknown. Here, we provide a significantly improved method for 'motif-blind' CRM discovery that does not depend on knowledge or accurate prediction of TF-binding motifs and is effective when limited knowledge of functional CRMs is available to 'supervise' the search. We propose a new statistical method, based on 'Interpolated Markov Models', for motif-blind, genome-wide CRM discovery. It captures the statistical profile of variable length words in known CRMs of a regulatory network and finds candidate CRMs that match this profile. The method also uses orthologs of the known CRMs from closely related genomes. We perform in silico evaluation of predicted CRMs by assessing whether their neighboring genes are enriched for the expected expression patterns. This assessment uses a novel statistical test that extends the widely used Hypergeometric test of gene set enrichment to account for variability in intergenic lengths. We find that the new CRM prediction method is superior to existing methods. Finally, we experimentally validate 12 new CRM predictions by examining their regulatory activity in vivo in Drosophila; 10 of the tested CRMs were found to be functional, while 6 of the top 7 predictions showed the expected activity patterns. We make our program available as downloadable source code, and as a plugin for a genome browser installed on our servers.},

abstract = {In developing organs, the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle exit is coordinated. How this coordination is achieved, however, is not clear. We show that the cyclin kinase inhibitor p57 regulates cell cycle exit of progenitors during the early stages of pancreas formation. In the absence of p57, the number of cycling progenitors increases, although expansion of progenitor population is prevented by apoptosis. We report that p57 is a direct target of transcriptional repression by Notch effector, Hes1. Inactivation of Hes1 results in the upregulation of p57 expression in progenitors, leading to cell cycle arrest, precocious differentiation and depletion of the progenitor pool. We present evidence that in p57/Hes1 double null embryos, the absence of apoptosis results in the expansion of the progenitor population. We propose that Hes1 and p57 not only coordinate cell cycle exit and self-renewal of pancreatic progenitors during an early stage in organogenesis to regulate the number of pancreatic progenitors, but could also constitute a surveillance system to eliminate cells with aberrant cell cycle characteristics.},

title = {Inferring the transcriptional landscape of bovine skeletal muscle by integrating co-expression networks},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite modern technologies and novel computational approaches, decoding causal transcriptional regulation remains challenging. This is particularly true for less well studied organisms and when only gene expression data is available. In muscle a small number of well characterised transcription factors are proposed to regulate development. Therefore, muscle appears to be a tractable system for proposing new computational approaches. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report a simple algorithm that asks "which transcriptional regulator has the highest average absolute co-expression correlation to the genes in a co-expression module?" It correctly infers a number of known causal regulators of fundamental biological processes, including cell cycle activity (E2F1), glycolysis (HLF), mitochondrial transcription (TFB2M), adipogenesis (PIAS1), neuronal development (TLX3), immune function (IRF1) and vasculogenesis (SOX17), within a skeletal muscle context. However, none of the canonical pro-myogenic transcription factors (MYOD1, MYOG, MYF5, MYF6 and MEF2C) were linked to muscle structural gene expression modules. Co-expression values were computed using developing bovine muscle from 60 days post conception (early foetal) to 30 months post natal (adulthood) for two breeds of cattle, in addition to a nutritional comparison with a third breed. A number of transcriptional landscapes were constructed and integrated into an always correlated landscape. One notable feature was a 'metabolic axis' formed from glycolysis genes at one end, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein genes at the other, and centrally tethered by mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial protein genes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The new module-to-regulator algorithm complements our recently described Regulatory Impact Factor analysis. Together with a simple examination of a co-expression module's contents, these three gene expression approaches are starting to illuminate the in vivo transcriptional regulation of skeletal muscle development.},

title = {Long noncoding RNAs in mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency and differentiation},
abstract = {The transcriptional networks that regulate embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency and lineage specification are the subject of considerable attention. To date such studies have focused almost exclusively on protein-coding transcripts. However, recent transcriptome analyses show that the mammalian genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), many of which appear to be expressed in a developmentally regulated manner. The functions of these remain untested. To identify ncRNAs involved in ES cell biology, we used a custom-designed microarray to examine the expression profiles of mouse ES cells differentiating as embryoid bodies (EBs) over a 16-d time course. We identified 945 ncRNAs expressed during EB differentiation, of which 174 were differentially expressed, many correlating with pluripotency or specific differentiation events. Candidate ncRNAs were identified for further characterization by an integrated examination of expression profiles, genomic context, chromatin state, and promoter analysis. Many ncRNAs showed coordinated expression with genomically associated developmental genes, such as Dlx1, Dlx4, Gata6, and Ecsit. We examined two novel developmentally regulated ncRNAs, Evx1as and Hoxb5/6as, which are derived from homeotic loci and share similar expression patterns and localization in mouse embryos with their associated protein-coding genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence that both ncRNAs are associated with trimethylated H3K4 histones and histone methyltransferase MLL1, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation of homeotic loci during ES cell differentiation. Taken together, our data indicate that long ncRNAs are likely to be important in processes directing pluripotency and alternative differentiation programs, in some cases through engagement of the epigenetic machinery.},

title = {Analysis of transposon interruptions suggests selection for L1 elements on the X chromosome},
abstract = {It has been hypothesised that the massive accumulation of L1 transposable elements on the X chromosome is due to their function in X inactivation, and that the accumulation of Alu elements near genes is adaptive. We tested the possible selective advantage of these two transposable element (TE) families with a novel method, interruption analysis. In mammalian genomes, a large number of TEs interrupt other TEs due to the high overall abundance and age of repeats, and these interruptions can be used to test whether TEs are selectively neutral. Interruptions of TEs, which are beneficial for the host, are expected to be deleterious and underrepresented compared with neutral ones. We found that L1 elements in the regions of the X chromosome that contain the majority of the inactivated genes are significantly less frequently interrupted than on the autosomes, while L1s near genes that escape inactivation are interrupted with higher frequency, supporting the hypothesis that L1s on the X chromosome play a role in its inactivation. In addition, we show that TEs are less frequently interrupted in introns than in intergenic regions, probably due to selection against the expansion of introns, but the insertion pattern of Alus is comparable to other repeats.},

title = {Evolutionary rate analyses of orthologs and paralogs from 12 Drosophila genomes},
abstract = {The newly sequenced genome sequences of 11 Drosophila species provide the first opportunity to investigate variations in evolutionary rates across a clade of closely related species. Protein-coding genes were predicted using established Drosophila melanogaster genes as templates, with recovery rates ranging from 81%-97% depending on species divergence and on genome assembly quality. Orthology and paralogy assignments were shown to be self-consistent among the different Drosophila species and to be consistent with regions of conserved gene order (synteny blocks). Next, we investigated the rates of diversification among these species' gene repertoires with respect to amino acid substitutions and to gene duplications. Constraints on amino acid sequences appear to have been most pronounced on D. ananassae and least pronounced on D. simulans and D. erecta terminal lineages. Codons predicted to have been subject to positive selection were found to be significantly over-represented among genes with roles in immune response and RNA metabolism, with the latter category including each subunit of the Dicer-2/r2d2 heterodimer. The vast majority of gene duplications (96.5%) and synteny rearrangements were found to occur, as expected, within single M{\"u}ller elements. We show that the rate of ancient gene duplications was relatively uniform. However, gene duplications in terminal lineages are strongly skewed toward very recent events, consistent with either a rapid-birth and rapid-death model or the presence of large proportions of copy number variable genes in these Drosophila populations. Duplications were significantly more frequent among trypsin-like proteases and DM8 putative lipid-binding domain proteins.},

title = {Control of somatic tissue differentiation by the long non-coding RNA TINCR},
abstract = {Several of the thousands of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been functionally characterized; however, potential roles for lncRNAs in somatic tissue differentiation remain poorly understood. Here we show that a 3.7-kilobase lncRNA, terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA (TINCR), controls human epidermal differentiation by a post-transcriptional mechanism. TINCR is required for high messenger RNA abundance of key differentiation genes, many of which are mutated in human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, ABCA12, CASP14 and ELOVL3. TINCR-deficient epidermis lacked terminal differentiation ultrastructure, including keratohyalin granules and intact lamellar bodies. Genome-scale RNA interactome analysis revealed that TINCR interacts with a range of differentiation mRNAs. TINCR-mRNA interaction occurs through a 25-nucleotide 'TINCR box' motif that is strongly enriched in interacting mRNAs and required for TINCR binding. A high-throughput screen to analyse TINCR binding capacity to approximately 9,400 human recombinant proteins revealed direct binding of TINCR RNA to the staufen1 (STAU1) protein. STAU1-deficient tissue recapitulated the impaired differentiation seen with TINCR depletion. Loss of UPF1 and UPF2, both of which are required for STAU1-mediated RNA decay, however, did not have differentiation effects. Instead, the TINCR-STAU1 complex seems to mediate stabilization of differentiation mRNAs, such as KRT80. These data identify TINCR as a key lncRNA required for somatic tissue differentiation, which occurs through lncRNA binding to differentiation mRNAs to ensure their expression.},

abstract = {A fundamental aspect of developmental decisions is the ability of groups of cells to obtain the competence to respond to different signalling inputs. This information is often integrated with intrinsic transcriptional networks to produce diverse developmental outcomes. Studies in Drosophila are starting to reveal a detailed picture of the regulatory circuits controlling the subdivision of the dorsal mesoderm, which gives rise to diverse muscle types including cardioblasts, pericardial cells, body wall muscle and gut muscle. The combination of a common set of mesoderm autonomous transcription factors (e.g. Tinman and Twist) and spatially restricted inductive signals (e.g. Dpp and Wg) subdivide the dorsal mesoderm into different competence domains. The integration of additional signalling inputs with localised repression within these competence domains results in diverse transcriptional responses within neighbouring cells, which in turn generates muscle diversity.},

title = {Improved contact prediction in proteins: Using pseudolikelihoods to infer Potts models},
abstract = {Spatially proximate amino acids in a protein tend to coevolve. A protein's 3D structure hence leaves an echo of correlations in the evolutionary record. Reverse engineering 3D structures from such correlations is an open problem in structural biology, pursued with increasing vigor as more and more protein sequences continue to fill the data banks. Within this task lies a statistical inference problem, rooted in the following: correlation between two sites in a protein sequence can arise from firsthand interaction, but can also be network-propagated via intermediate sites; observed correlation is not enough to guarantee proximity. To separate direct from indirect interactions is an instance of the general problem of inverse statistical mechanics, where the task is to learn model parameters (fields, couplings) from observables (magnetizations, correlations, samples) in large systems. In the context of protein sequences, the approach is referred to as direct-coupling analysis. Here we show that the pseudolikelihood method, applied to 21-state Potts models describing the statistical properties of families of evolutionarily related proteins, significantly outperforms existing approaches to the direct-coupling analysis, the latter being based on standard mean-field techniques. The results are verified using known crystal structures of specific sequence instances of various protein families.},

title = {INDELSCAN: a web server for comparative identification of species-specific and non-species-specific insertion/deletion events},
abstract = {Insertion and deletion (indel) events usually have dramatic effects on genome structure and gene function. Species-specific indels have been demonstrated to be associated with species-unique traits. Currently, indel identifications mainly rely on pair-wise sequence alignments (the 'pair-wise indels'), which suffer lack of discrimination of species specificity and insertion versus deletion. Also, there is no freely accessible web server for genome-wide identification of indels. Therefore, we develop a web server--INDELSCAN--to identify four types of indels using multiple sequence alignments that include sequences from one target, one subject and > or =1 out-group species. The four types of indels identified encompass target species-specific, subject species-specific, non-species-specific and target-subject pair-wise indels. Insertions and deletions are discriminated with reference to out-group sequences. The genomic locations (5'UTR, intron, CDS, 3'UTR and intergenic region) of these indels are also provided for functional analysis. INDELSCAN provides genomic sequences and gene annotations from a wide spectrum of taxa for users to select from, including nine target species (human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), dog (Canis familiaris), opossum (Monodelphis domestica), chicken (Gallus gallus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and >35 subject/out-group species, ranging from yeasts to mammals. The server also provides analytic figures and supports indel identification from user-uploaded alignments/annotations. INDELSCAN is freely accessible at http://indelscan.genomics.sinica.edu.tw/IndelScan/.},

title = {Optimizing information flow in small genetic networks. III. A self-interacting gene},
abstract = {Living cells must control the reading out or "expression" of information encoded in their genomes, and this regulation often is mediated by transcription factors-proteins that bind to DNA and either enhance or repress the expression of nearby genes. But the expression of transcription factor proteins is itself regulated, and many transcription factors regulate their own expression in addition to responding to other input signals. Here we analyze the simplest of such self-regulatory circuits, asking how parameters can be chosen to optimize information transmission from inputs to outputs in the steady state. Some nonzero level of self-regulation is almost always optimal, with self-activation dominant when transcription factor concentrations are low and self-repression dominant when concentrations are high. In steady state the optimal self-activation is never strong enough to induce bistability, although there is a limit in which the optimal parameters are very close to the critical point.},

abstract = {Hox genes are central to the specification of structures along the anterior-posterior body axis, and modifications in their expression have paralleled the emergence of diversity in vertebrate body plans. Here we describe the genomic organization of Hox clusters in different reptiles and show that squamates have accumulated unusually large numbers of transposable elements at these loci, reflecting extensive genomic rearrangements of coding and non-coding regulatory regions. Comparative expression analyses between two species showing different axial skeletons, the corn snake and the whiptail lizard, revealed major alterations in Hox13 and Hox10 expression features during snake somitogenesis, in line with the expansion of both caudal and thoracic regions. Variations in both protein sequences and regulatory modalities of posterior Hox genes suggest how this genetic system has dealt with its intrinsic collinear constraint to accompany the substantial morphological radiation observed in this group.},

In clonal populations, this may be achieved through sensing followed by response or through the generation of diversity by stochastic phenotype switching. Here we show that stochastic switching can be favored over sensing when the environment changes infrequently. The optimal switching rates then mimic the statistics of environmental changes. We derive a relation between the long-term growth rate of the organism and the information available about its fluctuating environment.},

title = {Universally sloppy parameter sensitivities in systems biology models},
abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

We construct here the information theoretic analog of connected correlation functions: irreducible {\$}N{\$}-point correlation is measured by a decrease in entropy for the joint distribution of {\$}N{\$} variables relative to the maximum entropy allowed by all the observed {\$}N-1{\$} variable distributions.

title = {The homeoprotein six1 transcriptionally activates multiple protumorigenic genes but requires ezrin to promote metastasis},
abstract = {The vast majority of deaths associated with cancer are a consequence of a complex phenotypic behavior, metastasis, by which tumor cells spread from their primary site of origin to regional and distant sites. This process requires the tumor cell to make numerous adjustments, both subtle and dramatic, to successfully reach, survive, and flourish at favorable secondary sites. It has been suggested that molecular mechanisms accounting for metastatic behavior can recapitulate those employed during embryogenesis. We have shown that the homeodomain transcription factor Six1, known to be required for normal development of migratory myogenic progenitor cells, is sufficient to promote metastatic spread in a mouse model of the pediatric skeletal muscle cancer rhabdomyosarcoma. Here, we report that Six1 is able to activate the expression of a set of protumorigenic genes (encoding cyclin D1, c-Myc, and Ezrin) that can control cell proliferation, survival, and motility. Although the role of Ezrin in cytoskeletal organization and adhesion has been well studied, the means by which its expression is regulated are poorly understood. We now show that the gene encoding Ezrin is a direct transcriptional target of Six1. Moreover, Ezrin is indispensable for Six1-induced metastasis and highly expressed in a panel of representative pediatric cancers. Our data indicate that Ezrin represents a promising therapeutic target for patients with advanced-stage rhabdomyosarcoma and perhaps other malignancies.},

abstract = {To begin to investigate the mechanism by which the human adenovirus type 5 E1B 55 kDa protein protects against anti-viral effects of type 1 interferon IFN (Chahal, J.S., Qi, J. and S.J. Flint (2012) PLoS Pathogens 8 doi:10:1371), we examined the effects of precise amino acid substitution in this protein on resistance of viral replication to the cytokine. Only substitution by alanine of residues 443-448 (E1B Sub19) specifically impaired production of progeny virus, and resulted in a large defect in viral DNA synthesis in IFN-treated normal human fibroblasts. Untreated or IFN-treated cells infected by this mutant virus (AdEasyE1Sub19) contained much higher steady-state concentrations of IFN-inducible GBP1 and IFIT2 mRNAs than did wild type-infected cells, and of the corresponding newly transcribed pre-mRNAs, isolated exploiting 5-ethynyluridine labeling and click chemistry. These results indicated that the Sub19 mutations impair repression of transcription of IFN-inducible genes by the E1B 55 kDa protein, consistent with their location in a segment required for repression of p53 dependent transcription. However, when synthesized alone, the E1B 55 kDa protein inhibited expression of the p53-regulated genes BAX and MDM2, but had no impact whatsoever on induction of IFIT2 and GBP1 expression by IFN. These observations correlate repression of transcription of IFN-inducible genes by the E1B 55 kDa protein with protection against inhibition of viral genome replication, and indicate that the E1B 55 kDa protein is not sufficient to establish such transcriptional repression.},

This relationship determines our ability to predict phenotypes from genotypes and to understand how evolutionary forces shape variation within and between species. Previous efforts to dissect the genotype-phenotype map were based on incomplete genotypic information. Here, we describe the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a community resource for analysis of population genomics and quantitative traits. The DGRP consists of fully sequenced inbred lines derived from a natural population. Population genomic analyses reveal reduced polymorphism in centromeric autosomal regions and the X chromosome, evidence for positive and negative selection, and rapid evolution of the X chromosome. Many variants in novel genes, most at low frequency, are associated with quantitative traits and explain a large fraction of the phenotypic variance. The DGRP facilitates genotype-phenotype mapping using the power of Drosophila genetics.},

title = {D-six4 plays a key role in patterning cell identities deriving from the Drosophila mesoderm},
abstract = {Patterning of the Drosophila embryonic mesoderm requires the regulation of cell type-specific factors in response to dorsoventral and anteroposterior axis information. For the dorsoventral axis, the homeodomain gene, tinman, is a key patterning mediator for dorsal mesodermal fates like the heart. However, equivalent mediators for more ventral fates are unknown. We show that D-six4, which encodes a Six family transcription factor, is required for the appropriate development of most cell types deriving from the non-dorsal mesoderm - the fat body, somatic cells of the gonad, and a specific subset of somatic muscles. Misexpression analysis suggests that D-Six4 and its likely cofactor, Eyes absent, are sufficient to impose these fates on other mesodermal cells. At stage 10, the mesodermal expression patterns of D-six4 and tin are complementary, being restricted to the dorsal and non-dorsal regions respectively. Our data suggest that D-six4 is a key mesodermal patterning mediator at this stage that regulates a variety of cell-type-specific factors and hence plays an equivalent role to tin. At stage 9, however, D-six4 and tin are both expressed pan-mesodermally. At this stage, tin function is required for full D-six4 expression. This may explain the known requirement for tin in some non-dorsal cell types.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Upstream sequences contain short motifs, which mediate transcriptional regulation by specifically binding different transcription factors. The presence of common motifs in the regulatory regions of two genes might be considered as a clue for a potential co-regulation. A pattern count-based (dis)similarity metric between sequences could thus be used to classify genes according to their putative regulatory properties. RESULTS: We present here several metrics which rely on probability theory, and which aim at comparing sequences on the basis of pattern counts. We compare these metrics to several classical dissimilarity and similarity metrics, and illustrate their behaviour with a biological example.},

title = {pRb: master of differentiation. Coupling irreversible cell cycle withdrawal with induction of muscle-specific transcription},
abstract = {The protein product of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene is necessary for the completion of the muscle differentiation program and for myogenic basic helix-loop-helix-dependent transcription. In fact, in addition to induction and maintenance of permanent cell cycle withdrawal through negative regulation of E2F-responsive genes involved in proliferation, pRb also plays a positive role in the activation of muscle-specific genes. In pRb-/- myocytes, the expression of late myogenic markers is defective and myoblast fusion into myotubes occurs without irreversible cell cycle exit. This evidence demonstrates only a partial functional redundancy between pRb and its relatives p107 and pRb2/p130, as these pRb-/- multinucleated cells, which display p107 levels higher than normal myotubes, respond to mitogens with cell cycle re-entry and DNA synthesis. At the molecular level, pRb myogenic functions are mediated by cooperation with MyoD, Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), High mobility group box protein-1 (HBP1) and histone deacetylase1, affecting chromatin configuration and tissue-specific transcription, and by post-translational modification in response to intracellular signaling cascades.},

title = {Identification of transcriptional targets for Six5: implication for the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy type 1},
abstract = {Myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) is the most common inherited neuromuscular disease in adults. The disorder, characterized by myotonia, muscle wasting and weakness, cataract, insulin resistance, and mental impairment, is caused by the expansion of an unstable CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of DMPK. The repeat expansion suppresses the expression of the homeobox gene SIX5. We describe here an experimental system to identify downstream transcriptional targets of mouse Six5 in order to elucidate the role of SIX5 in the pathogenesis of DM1 and development. By overexpressing a constitutively active Six5 (VP16-Six5wt) using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in P19 cells and subsequent expression profiling using cDNA arrays, 21 genes, whose expression level increased by the treatment, were identified as potential target genes. Genes expressed in the somites, skeletal muscles, brain and meninges comprised the majority, suggesting the role of Six5 in the development and function of mesodermal tissues and brain. We provide evidence that Igfbp5 encoding a component of IGF signaling is a direct Six5-target. Moreover, the overall expression level of Igfbp5 was decreased in Six5-deficient mouse fibroblasts, and the response of human IGFBP5 to MyoD-induced muscle conversion was altered in cells of DM1 patients. Our results not only identify Six5 as an activator that directs Igfbp5 expression but also suggest that reduced SIX5 expression in DM1 might contribute to specific aspects of the DM1 phenotype.},

title = {Mrf4 determines skeletal muscle identity in Myf5:Myod double-mutant mice},
abstract = {In vertebrates, skeletal muscle is a model for the acquisition of cell fate from stem cells. Two determination factors of the basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) family, Myf5 and Myod, are thought to direct this transition because double-mutant mice totally lack skeletal muscle fibres and myoblasts. In the absence of these factors, progenitor cells remain multipotent and can change their fate. Gene targeting studies have revealed hierarchical relationships between these and the other MRF genes, Mrf4 and myogenin, where the latter are regarded as differentiation genes. Here we show, using an allelic series of three Myf5 mutants that differentially affect the expression of the genetically linked Mrf4 gene, that skeletal muscle is present in the new Myf5:Myod double-null mice only when Mrf4 expression is not compromised. This finding contradicts the widely held view that myogenic identity is conferred solely by Myf5 and Myod, and identifies Mrf4 as a determination gene. We revise the epistatic relationship of the MRFs, in which both Myf5 and Mrf4 act upstream of Myod to direct embryonic multipotent cells into the myogenic lineage.},

title = {A novel myogenic regulatory circuit controls slow/cardiac troponin C gene transcription in skeletal muscle},
abstract = {The slow/cardiac troponin C (cTnC) gene is expressed in three distinct striated muscle lineages: cardiac myocytes, embryonic fast skeletal myotubes, and adult slow skeletal myocytes. We have reported previously that cTnC gene expression in cardiac muscle is regulated by a cardiac-specific promoter/enhancer located in the 5' flanking region of the gene (bp -124 to +1). In this report, we demonstrate that the cTnC gene contains a second distinct and independent transcriptional enhancer which is located in the first intron. This second enhancer is skeletal myotube specific and is developmentally up-regulated during the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes. This enhancer contains three functionally important nuclear protein binding sites: a CACCC box, a MEF-2 binding site, and a previously undescribed nuclear protein binding site, designated MEF-3, which is also present in a large number of skeletal muscle-specific transcriptional enhancers. Unlike most skeletal muscle-specific transcriptional regulatory elements, the cTnC enhancer does not contain a consensus binding site (CANNTG) for the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors and does not directly bind MyoD-E12 protein complexes. Despite these findings, the cTnC enhancer can be transactivated by overexpression of the myogenic bHLH proteins, MyoD and myogenin, in C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated changes in the patterns of MEF-2, CACCC, and MEF-3 DNA binding activities following the conversion of 10T1/2 cells into myoblasts and myotubes by stable transfection with a MyoD expression vector. In particular, MEF-2 binding activity was up-regulated in 10T1/2 cells stably transfected with a MyoD expression vector only after these cells fused and differentiated into skeletal myotubes. Taken together, these results demonstrated that distinct lineage-specific transcriptional regulatory elements control the expression of a single myofibrillar protein gene in fast skeletal and cardiac muscle. In addition, they show that bHLH transcription factors can indirectly transactivate the expression of some muscle-specific genes.},

title = {Genome-wide MyoD binding in skeletal muscle cells: a potential for broad cellular reprogramming},
abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that MyoD initiates a feed-forward regulation of skeletal muscle gene expression, predicting that MyoD binds directly to many genes expressed during differentiation. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing to identify genome-wide binding of MyoD in several skeletal muscle cell types. As anticipated, MyoD preferentially binds to a VCASCTG sequence that resembles the in vitro-selected site for a MyoD:E-protein heterodimer, and MyoD binding increases during differentiation at many of the regulatory regions of genes expressed in skeletal muscle. Unanticipated findings were that MyoD was constitutively bound to thousands of additional sites in both myoblasts and myotubes, and that the genome-wide binding of MyoD was associated with regional histone acetylation. Therefore, in addition to regulating muscle gene expression, MyoD binds genome wide and has the ability to broadly alter the epigenome in myoblasts and myotubes.},

abstract = {In higher eukaryotes, transcriptional enhancers play critical roles in the integration of cellular signaling information, but apart from a few well-studied model enhancers, we lack a general picture of transcriptional information processing by most enhancers. Here we discuss recent studies that have provided fresh insights on information processing that occurs on enhancers, and propose that in addition to the highly cooperative and coordinate action of "enhanceosomes", a less integrative, but more flexible form of information processing is mediated by information display or "billboard" enhancers. Application of these models has important ramifications not only for the biochemical analysis of transcription, but also for the wider fields of bioinformatics and evolutionary biology.},

title = {Eya1 and Eya2 proteins are required for hypaxial somitic myogenesis in the mouse embryo},
abstract = {In mammals, Pax3, Six4, Six1 and Six5 genes are co-expressed with Eya1, Eya2 and Eya4 genes during mouse somitogenesis. To unravel the functions of Eya genes during muscle development, we analyzed myogenesis in Eya2-/- and in Eya1-/- embryos. A delay in limb myogenesis was observed between E10 and E13 in Eya1-/- embryos only, that is later compensated. Compound E18 Eya1-/-Eya2-/+ fetuses present a muscle phenotype comparable with that of Six1-/- fetuses; lacking a diaphragm and with a specific absence of limb muscles, suggesting either genetic epistasis between Six and Eya genes, or biochemical interactions between Six and Eya proteins. We tested these two non-exclusive possibilities. First, we show that Six proteins recruit Eya proteins to drive transcription during embryogenesis in the dermomyotomal epaxial and hypaxial lips of the somites by binding MEF3 DNA sites. Second, we show that Pax3 expression is lost in the ventrolateral (hypaxial) dermomyotomes of the somite in both Eya1-/-Eya2-/- embryos and in Six1-/-Six4-/- embryos, precluding hypaxial lip formation. This structure, from which myogenic cells delaminate to invade the limb does not form in these double mutant embryos, leading to limb buds without myogenic progenitor cells. Eya1 and Eya2, however, are still expressed in the somites of Six1Six4 double mutant and in splotch embryos, and Six1 is expressed in the somites of Eya1Eya2 double mutant embryos and in splotch embryos. Altogether these results show that Six and Eya genes lie genetically upstream of Pax3 gene in the formation of ventrolateral dermomyotome hypaxial lips. No genetic links have been characterized between Six and Eya genes, but corresponding proteins activate key muscle determination genes (Myod, Myogenin and Mrf4). These results establish a new hierarchy of genes controlling early steps of hypaxial myogenic commitment in the mouse embryo.},

We need, therefore, an approach that stresses the systemic complexity of economic networks and that can be used to revise and extend established paradigms in economic theory. This will facilitate the design of policies that reduce conflicts between individual interests and global efficiency, as well as reduce the risk of global failure by making economic networks more robust.},

title = {A two-tiered mechanism for stabilization and immobilization of E-cadherin},
abstract = {Epithelial tissues maintain a robust architecture which is important for their barrier function, but they are also remodelled through the reorganization of cell-cell contacts. Tissue stability requires intercellular adhesion mediated by E-cadherin, in particular its trans-association in homophilic complexes supported by actin filaments through beta- and alpha-catenin. How alpha-catenin dynamic interactions between E-cadherin/beta-catenin and cortical actin control both stability and remodelling of adhesion is unclear. Here we focus on Drosophila homophilic E-cadherin complexes rather than total E-cadherin, including diffusing 'free' E-cadherin, because these complexes are a better proxy for adhesion. We find that E-cadherin complexes partition in very stable microdomains (that is, bona fide adhesive foci which are more stable than remodelling contacts). Furthermore, we find that stability and mobility of these microdomains depend on two actin populations: small, stable actin patches concentrate at homophilic E-cadherin clusters, whereas a rapidly turning over, contractile network constrains their lateral movement by a tethering mechanism. alpha-Catenin controls epithelial architecture mainly through regulation of the mobility of homophilic clusters and it is largely dispensable for their stability. Uncoupling stability and mobility of E-cadherin complexes suggests that stable epithelia may remodel through the regulated mobility of very stable adhesive foci.},

abstract = {The genetic and biochemical networks which underlie such things as homeostasis in metabolism and the developmental programs of living cells, must withstand considerable variations and random perturbations of biochemical parameters. These occur as transient changes in, for example, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation. The intensity and duration of these perturbations differ between cells in a population. The unique state of cells, and thus the diversity in a population, is owing to the different environmental stimuli the individual cells experience and the inherent stochastic nature of biochemical processes (for example, refs 5 and 6). It has been proposed, but not demonstrated, that autoregulatory, negative feedback loops in gene circuits provide stability, thereby limiting the range over which the concentrations of network components fluctuate. Here we have designed and constructed simple gene circuits consisting of a regulator and transcriptional repressor modules in Escherichia coli and we show the gain of stability produced by negative feedback.},

title = {Myf5 is a direct target of long-range Shh signaling and Gli regulation for muscle specification},
abstract = {Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted signaling molecule for tissue patterning and stem cell specification in vertebrate embryos. Shh mediates both long-range and short-range signaling responses in embryonic tissues through the activation and repression of target genes by its Gli transcription factor effectors. Despite the well-established functions of Shh signaling in development and human disease, developmental target genes of Gli regulation are virtually unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of Shh signaling in the control of Myf5, a skeletal muscle regulatory gene for specification of muscle stem cells in vertebrate embryos. In previous genetic studies, we showed that Shh is required for Myf5 expression in the specification of dorsal somite, epaxial muscle progenitors. However, these studies did not distinguish whether Myf5 is a direct target of Gli regulation through long-range Shh signaling, or alternatively, whether Myf5 regulation is a secondary response to Shh signaling. To address this question, we have used transgenic analysis with lacZ reporter genes to characterize an Myf5 transcription enhancer that controls the activation of Myf5 expression in the somite epaxial muscle progenitors in mouse embryos. This Myf5 epaxial somite (ES) enhancer is Shh-dependent, as shown by its complete inactivity in somites of homozygous Shh mutant embryos, and by its reduced activity in heterozygous Shh mutant embryos. Furthermore, Shh and downstream Shh signal transducers specifically induce ES enhancer/luciferase reporters in Shh-responsive 3T3 cells. A Gli-binding site located within the ES enhancer is required for enhancer activation by Shh signaling in transfected 3T3 cells and in epaxial somite progenitors in transgenic embryos. These findings establish that Myf5 is a direct target of long-range Shh signaling through positive regulation by Gli transcription factors, providing evidence that Shh signaling has a direct inductive function in cell lineage specification.},

title = {Predicting spatial and temporal gene expression using an integrative model of transcription factor occupancy and chromatin state},
abstract = {Precise patterns of spatial and temporal gene expression are central to metazoan complexity and act as a driving force for embryonic development. While there has been substantial progress in dissecting and predicting cis-regulatory activity, our understanding of how information from multiple enhancer elements converge to regulate a gene's expression remains elusive. This is in large part due to the number of different biological processes involved in mediating regulation as well as limited availability of experimental measurements for many of them. Here, we used a Bayesian approach to model diverse experimental regulatory data, leading to accurate predictions of both spatial and temporal aspects of gene expression. We integrated whole-embryo information on transcription factor recruitment to multiple cis-regulatory modules, insulator binding and histone modification status in the vicinity of individual gene loci, at a genome-wide scale during Drosophila development. The model uses Bayesian networks to represent the relation between transcription factor occupancy and enhancer activity in specific tissues and stages. All parameters are optimized in an Expectation Maximization procedure providing a model capable of predicting tissue- and stage-specific activity of new, previously unassayed genes. Performing the optimization with subsets of input data demonstrated that neither enhancer occupancy nor chromatin state alone can explain all gene expression patterns, but taken together allow for accurate predictions of spatio-temporal activity. Model predictions were validated using the expression patterns of more than 600 genes recently made available by the BDGP consortium, demonstrating an average 15-fold enrichment of genes expressed in the predicted tissue over a na{\"\i}ve model. We further validated the model by experimentally testing the expression of 20 predicted target genes of unknown expression, resulting in an accuracy of 95% for temporal predictions and 50% for spatial. While this is, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide approach to predict tissue-specific gene expression in metazoan development, our results suggest that integrative models of this type will become more prevalent in the future.},

title = {Benchmarking tools for the alignment of functional noncoding DNA},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous tools have been developed to align genomic sequences. However, their relative performance in specific applications remains poorly characterized. Alignments of protein-coding sequences typically have been benchmarked against "correct" alignments inferred from structural data. For noncoding sequences, where such independent validation is lacking, simulation provides an effective means to generate "correct" alignments with which to benchmark alignment tools. RESULTS: Using rates of noncoding sequence evolution estimated from the genus Drosophila, we simulated alignments over a range of divergence times under varying models incorporating point substitution, insertion/deletion events, and short blocks of constrained sequences such as those found in cis-regulatory regions. We then compared "correct" alignments generated by a modified version of the ROSE simulation platform to alignments of the simulated derived sequences produced by eight pairwise alignment tools (Avid, BlastZ, Chaos, ClustalW, DiAlign, Lagan, Needle, and WABA) to determine the off-the-shelf performance of each tool. As expected, the ability to align noncoding sequences accurately decreases with increasing divergence for all tools, and declines faster in the presence of insertion/deletion evolution. Global alignment tools (Avid, ClustalW, Lagan, and Needle) typically have higher sensitivity over entire noncoding sequences as well as in constrained sequences. Local tools (BlastZ, Chaos, and WABA) have lower overall sensitivity as a consequence of incomplete coverage, but have high specificity to detect constrained sequences as well as high sensitivity within the subset of sequences they align. Tools such as DiAlign, which generate both local and global outputs, produce alignments of constrained sequences with both high sensitivity and specificity for divergence distances in the range of 1.25-3.0 substitutions per site. CONCLUSION: For species with genomic properties similar to Drosophila, we conclude that a single pair of optimally diverged species analyzed with a high performance alignment tool can yield accurate and specific alignments of functionally constrained noncoding sequences. Further algorithm development, optimization of alignment parameters, and benchmarking studies will be necessary to extract the maximal biological information from alignments of functional noncoding DNA.},

title = {Identification of muscle-specific regulatory modules in Caenorhabditis elegans},
abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is the major regulatory mechanism that controls the spatial and temporal expression of genes during development. This is carried out by transcription factors (TFs), which recognize and bind to their cognate binding sites. Recent studies suggest a modular organization of TF-binding sites, in which clusters of transcription-factor binding sites cooperate in the regulation of downstream gene expression. In this study, we report our computational identification and experimental verification of muscle-specific cis-regulatory modules in Caenorhabditis elegans. We first identified a set of motifs that are correlated with muscle-specific gene expression. We then predicted muscle-specific regulatory modules based on clusters of those motifs with characteristics similar to a collection of well-studied modules in other species. The method correctly identifies 88% of the experimentally characterized modules with a positive predictive value of at least 65%. The prediction accuracy of muscle-specific expression on an independent test set is highly significant (P<0.0001). We performed in vivo experimental tests of 12 predicted modules, and 10 of those drive muscle-specific gene expression. These results suggest that our method is highly accurate in identifying functional sequences important for muscle-specific gene expression and is a valuable tool for guiding experimental designs.},

abstract = {Stability and function of eukaryotic genomes are closely linked to chromatin structure and organization. During cell division the entire genome must be accurately replicated and the chromatin landscape reproduced on new DNA. Chromatin and nuclear structure influence where and when DNA replication initiates, whereas the replication process itself disrupts chromatin and challenges established patterns of genome regulation. Specialized replication-coupled mechanisms assemble new DNA into chromatin, but epigenome maintenance is a continuous process taking place throughout the cell cycle. If DNA synthesis is perturbed, cells can suffer loss of both genome and epigenome integrity with severe consequences for the organism.},

abstract = {Recent advances in condensed matter theory have revealed that new and exotic phases of matter can exist in spin models (or more precisely, local bosonic models) via a simple physical mechanism, known as "string-net condensation." These new phases of matter have the unusual property that their collective excitations are gauge bosons and fermions. In some cases, the collective excitations can behave just like the photons, electrons, gluons, and quarks in our vacuum. This suggests that photons, electrons, and other elementary particles may have a unified origin - string-net condensation in our vacuum. In addition, the string-net picture indicates how to make artificial photons, artificial electrons, and artificial quarks and gluons in condensed matter systems.},

title = {Myocyte enhancer factor 2C and myogenin up-regulate each other's expression and induce the development of skeletal muscle in P19 cells},
abstract = {Two families of transcription factors, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), function synergistically to regulate myogenesis. In addition to activating structural muscle-specific genes, MRFs and MEF2 activate each other's expression. The MRF, myogenin, can activate MEF2 DNA binding activity when transfected into fibroblasts and, in turn, the myogenin promoter contains essential MEF2 DNA binding elements. To determine which MEF2 is involved in this regulation, P19 cells stably expressing MyoD and myogenin were compared for their ability to activate the expression of MEF2 family members. There was very little cross-activation of MyoD expression by myogenin and vice versa. Myogenin expression, and not MyoD, was found to up-regulate MEF2C expression. MEF2A, -B, and -D expression levels were not up-regulated by overexpression of either MyoD or myogenin. To examine whether MEF2C can differentially regulate MyoD or myogenin expression, P19 cell lines overexpressing MEF2C were analyzed. MEF2C induced myogenesis in P19 cells and up-regulated the expression of myogenin with 25-fold greater efficiency than that of MyoD. Therefore, myogenin and MEF2C participate in a regulatory loop in differentiating stem cells. This positive regulation does not extend to MyoD or the other MEF2 family members. Consequently, MEF2C appears to play a specific role in early events of myogenesis.},

abstract = {We introduce a quasi-equilibrium formalism in the theory of liquids in order to obtain a set of coarse grained long time dynamical equations for the two point density correlation functions. Our scheme allows to use typical approximations devised for equilibrium to study long time glassy dynamics. We study the Hypernetted Chain (HNC) approximation and a recent closure scheme by Szamel. In both cases we get dynamical equations that have the structure of the Mode-Coupling (MCT) equations in the long time region. The HNC approach, that was so far used to get equilibrium quantities is thus generalized to a fully consistent scheme where long-time dynamic quantities can also be computed. In the context of this approximation we get an asymptotic description of both equilibrium glassy dynamics at high temperature and of aging dynamics at low temperature. The Szamel approximation on the other hand is shown to lead to the exact Mode Coupling equation of G{\"o}tze for equilibrium dynamics. We clarify the way phase space is sampled according to MCT during dynamical relaxation.},

We have used replication-defective retroviral vectors to analyze the lineage relationships of these somite-derived cells in the chick. We find that myogenic precursors in the somites or proximal limb are not committed to forming slow or fast muscle fibers, particular anatomical muscles, or muscles within specific proximal/distal or dorsal/ventral limb regions. Somitic endothelial precursors are uncommitted to forming endothelium in particular proximal/distal or dorsal/ventral limb regions. Surprisingly, we also find that myogenic and endothelial cells are derived from a common somitic precursor. Thus, local extrinsic signals are critical for determining muscle and endothelial patterning as well as cell fate in the limb.},

title = {Individual histories and selection in heterogeneous populations},
abstract = {The strength of selection in populations has traditionally been inferred by measuring changes in bulk population parameters, such as mean reproductive rates. Untangling the effect of selection from other factors, such as specific responses to environmental fluctuations, poses a significant problem both in microbiology and in other fields, including cancer biology and immunology, where selection occurs within phenotypically heterogeneous populations of cells. Using "individual histories"--temporal sequences of all reproduction events and phenotypic changes of individuals and their ancestors--we present an alternative approach to quantifying selection in diverse experimental settings. Selection is viewed as a process that acts on histories, and a measure of selection that employs the distribution of histories is introduced. We apply this measure to phenotypically structured populations in fluctuating environments across different evolutionary regimes. Additionally, we show that reproduction events alone, recorded in the population's tree of cell divisions, may be sufficient to accurately measure selection. The measure is thus applicable in a wide range of biological systems, from microorganisms--including species for which genetic tools do not yet exist--to cellular populations, such as tumors and stem cells, where detailed temporal data are becoming available.},

title = {Canonical Wnt signalling induces satellite-cell proliferation during adult skeletal muscle regeneration},
abstract = {Satellite cells represent the stem cell population of adult skeletal muscle. The molecular mechanisms that control the proliferation of satellite cells are not well understood. In this study, we show that in response to injury, myofibres activate Wnt ligand transcription and activate a reporter cell line that is sensitive to the canonical Wnt-signalling pathway. Activated satellite cells on isolated cultured myofibres show robust expression of activated-beta-catenin (Act-beta-Cat), a key downstream transcriptional coactivator of canonical Wnt signalling. We provide evidence that the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins act on satellite cells in a ligand-specific manner. Overexpression of Wnt1, Wnt3a or Wnt5a protein causes a dramatic increase in satellite-cell proliferation. By contrast, exposure of satellite cells to Wnt4 or Wnt6 diminishes this process. Moreover, we show that the prolonged satellite-cell quiescence induced by inhibitory Wnt is reversible and exposing inhibited satellite cells to stimulatory Wnt signalling restores their proliferation rate. Stimulatory Wnt proteins induce premature satellite cell BrdU incorporation as well as nuclear translocation of Act-beta-Cat. Finally, we provide evidence that the Act-beta-Cat translocation observed in single fibres during in vitro culture also occurs in cases of acute and chronic skeletal muscle regeneration in rodents and humans. We propose that Wnt proteins may be key factors that regulate the rate of satellite-cell proliferation on adult muscle fibres during the wound-healing response.},

title = {Molecular interaction and synergistic activation of a promoter by Six, Eya, and Dach proteins mediated through CREB binding protein},
abstract = {Drosophila sine oculis, eyes absent, and dachshund are essential for compound eye formation and form a gene network with direct protein interaction and genetic regulation. The vertebrate homologues of these genes, Six, Eya, and Dach, also form a similar genetic network during muscle formation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the network among Six, Eya, and Dach, we examined the molecular interactions among the encoded proteins. Eya interacted directly with Six but never with Dach. Dach transactivated a multimerized GAL4 reporter gene by coproduction of GAL4-Eya fusion proteins. Transactivation by Eya and Dach was repressed by overexpression of VP16 or E1A but not by E1A mutation, which is defective for CREB binding protein (CBP) binding. Recruitment of CBP to the immobilized chromatin DNA template was dependent on FLAG-Dach and GAL4-Eya3. These results indicate that CBP is a mediator of the interaction between Eya and Dach. Contrary to our expectations, Dach binds to chromatin DNA by itself, not being tethered by GAL4-Eya3. Dach also binds to naked DNA with lower affinity. The conserved DD1 domain is responsible for binding to DNA. Transactivation was also observed by coproduction of GAL4-Six, Eya, and Dach, indicating that Eya and Dach synergy is relevant when Eya is tethered to DNA through Six protein. Our results demonstrated that synergy is mediated through direct interaction of Six-Eya and through the interaction of Eya-Dach with CBP and explain the molecular basis for the genetic interactions among Six, Eya, and Dach. This work provides fundamental information on the role and the mechanism of action of this gene cassette in tissue differentiation and organogenesis.},

title = {Myf5 expression in satellite cells and spindles in adult muscle is controlled by separate genetic elements},
abstract = {The myogenic regulatory factor Myf5 is integral to the initiation and control of skeletal muscle formation. In adult muscle, Myf5 is expressed in satellite cells, stem cells of mature muscle, but not in the myonuclei that sustain the myofibre. Using the Myf5(nlacZ/+) mouse, we now show that Myf5 is also constitutively expressed in muscle spindles-stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors, while muscle denervation induces extensive reactivation of the Myf5 gene in myonuclei. To identify the elements involved in the regulation of Myf5 in adult muscle, we analysed reporter gene expression in a transgenic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) deletion series of the Mrf4/Myf5 locus. A BAC carrying 140 kb upstream of the Myf5 transcription start site was sufficient to drive all aspects of Myf5 expression in adult muscle. In contrast, BACs carrying 88 and 59 kb upstream were unable to drive consistent expression in satellite cells, although expression in muscle spindles and reactivation of the locus in myonuclei were retained. Therefore, as during development, multiple enhancers are required to generate the full expression pattern of Myf5 in the adult. Together, these observations show that elements controlling adult Myf5 expression are genetically separable and possibly distinct from those that control Myf5 during development. These studies are a first step towards identifying cognate transcription factors involved in muscle stem cell regulation.},

title = {Distinguishing Driver and Passenger Mutations in an Evolutionary History Categorized by Interference},
abstract = {In many biological scenarios, from the development of drug resistance in pathogens to the progression of healthy cells towards cancer, quantifying the selection acting on observed mutations is a central question. One difficulty in answering this question is the complexity of the background upon which mutations can arise, with multiple potential interactions between genetic loci. We here present a method for discerning selection from a population history which accounts for interference between mutations. Given sequences sampled from multiple time-points in the history of a population, we infer selection at each locus by maximizing a likelihood function derived from a multi-locus evolution model. We apply the method to the question of distinguishing between loci where new mutations are under positive selection (drivers) and loci which emit neutral mutations (passengers) in a Wright-Fisher model of evolution. Relative to an otherwise equivalent method in which the genetic background of mutations was ignored, our method inferred selection coefficients more accurately for both driver mutations evolving under clonal interference, and for passenger mutations reaching fixation in the population through genetic drift or hitchhiking. In a population history recorded by 750 sets of sequences of 100 individuals taken at intervals of 100 generations, a set of 50 loci were divided into drivers and passengers with a mean accuracy of greater than 0.95 across a range of numbers of driver loci. The potential application of our model, either in full or in part, to a range of biological systems, is discussed.},

Non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons--including LINE-1, Alu and SVA elements--have proliferated over the past 80 million years of primate evolution and now account for approximately one-third of the human genome. In this Review, we focus on this major class of elements and discuss the many ways that they affect the human genome: from generating insertion mutations and genomic instability to altering gene expression and contributing to genetic innovation. Increasingly detailed analyses of human and other primate genomes are revealing the scale and complexity of the past and current contributions of non-LTR retrotransposons to genomic change in the human lineage.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) and their specific interactions with targets are crucial for specifying gene-expression programs. To gain insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks in embryonic stem (ES) cells, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map the locations of 13 sequence-specific TFs (Nanog, Oct4, STAT3, Smad1, Sox2, Zfx, c-Myc, n-Myc, Klf4, Esrrb, Tcfcp2l1, E2f1, and CTCF) and 2 transcription regulators (p300 and Suz12). These factors are known to play different roles in ES-cell biology as components of the LIF and BMP signaling pathways, self-renewal regulators, and key reprogramming factors. Our study provides insights into the integration of the signaling pathways into the ES-cell-specific transcription circuitries. Intriguingly, we find specific genomic regions extensively targeted by different TFs. Collectively, the comprehensive mapping of TF-binding sites identifies important features of the transcriptional regulatory networks that define ES-cell identity.},

title = {Hierarchy in complex systems: the possible and the actual},
abstract = {Hierarchy seems to pervade complexity in both living and artificial systems. Despite its relevance, no general theory that captures all features of hierarchy and its origins has been proposed yet. Here we present a formal approach resulting from the convergence of theoretical morphology and network theory that allows constructing a 3D morphospace of hierarchies and hence comparing the hierarchical organization of ecological, cellular, technological and social networks. Embedded within large voids in the morphospace of all possible hierarchies, four major groups are identified. Two of them match the expected from random networks with similar connectivity, thus suggesting that non-adaptive factors are at work. Ecological and gene networks define the other two, indicating that their topological order is the result of functional constraints. These results are consistent with an exploration of the morphospace using {\em in silico} evolved networks.},

title = {Genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein-DNA interactions},
abstract = {In vivo protein-DNA interactions connect each transcription factor with its direct targets to form a gene network scaffold. To map these protein-DNA interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes, we developed a large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIPSeq) based on direct ultrahigh-throughput DNA sequencing. This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; also known as REST, for repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [+/-50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area >/= 0.96] and statistical confidence (P <10(-4)), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development.},

Here we present an approach to systematically study similarity in the local structure of networks, based on the significance profile (SP) of small subgraphs in the network compared to randomized networks. We find several superfamilies of previously unrelated networks with very similar SPs. One superfamily, including transcription networks of microorganisms, represents "rate-limited" information-processing networks strongly constrained by the response time of their components. A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages.},

title = {Temporal regulation of the muscle gene cascade by Macho1 and Tbx6 transcription factors in Ciona intestinalis},
abstract = {For over a century, muscle formation in the ascidian embryo has been representative of 'mosaic' development. The molecular basis of muscle-fate predetermination has been partly elucidated with the discovery of Macho1, a maternal zinc-finger transcription factor necessary and sufficient for primary muscle development, and of its transcriptional intermediaries Tbx6b and Tbx6c. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the maternal information is decoded by cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) associated with muscle transcription factor and structural genes, and the ways by which a seamless transition from maternal to zygotic transcription is ensured, are still mostly unclear. By combining misexpression assays with CRM analyses, we have identified the mechanisms through which Ciona Macho1 (Ci-Macho1) initiates expression of Ci-Tbx6b and Ci-Tbx6c, and we have unveiled the cross-regulatory interactions between the latter transcription factors. Knowledge acquired from the analysis of the Ci-Tbx6b CRM facilitated both the identification of a related CRM in the Ci-Tbx6c locus and the characterization of two CRMs associated with the structural muscle gene fibrillar collagen 1 (CiFCol1). We use these representative examples to reconstruct how compact CRMs orchestrate the muscle developmental program from pre-localized ooplasmic determinants to differentiated larval muscle in ascidian embryos.},

Here, we report the characteristics of the regulatory network orchestrating early mesodermal development in the fruitfly Drosophila, where the transcription factor Twist is both necessary and sufficient to drive development. Through the integration of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis (ChIP-on-chip) experiments during discrete time periods with computational approaches, we identified >2000 Twist-bound cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and almost 500 direct target genes. Unexpectedly, Twist regulates an almost complete cassette of genes required for cell proliferation in addition to genes essential for morophogenesis and cell migration. Twist targets almost 25% of all annotated Drosophila transcription factors, which may represent the entire set of regulators necessary for the early development of this system. By combining in vivo binding data from Twist, Mef2, Tinman, and Dorsal we have constructed an initial transcriptional network of early mesoderm development. The network topology reveals extensive combinatorial binding, feed-forward regulation, and complex logical outputs as prevalent features. In addition to binary activation and repression, we suggest that Twist binds to almost all mesodermal CRMs to provide the competence to integrate inputs from more specialized transcription factors.},

title = {How citation distortions create unfounded authority: analysis of a citation network},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand belief in a specific scientific claim by studying the pattern of citations among papers stating it.

DESIGN: A complete citation network was constructed from all PubMed indexed English literature papers addressing the belief that beta amyloid, a protein accumulated in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, is produced by and injures skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myositis. Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this network.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Citation bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining authority.

RESULTS: The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220,553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding.

CONCLUSION: Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

title = {A stochastic spectral analysis of transcriptional regulatory cascades},
abstract = {The past decade has seen great advances in our understanding of the role of noise in gene regulation and the physical limits to signaling in biological networks. Here, we introduce the spectral method for computation of the joint probability distribution over all species in a biological network. The spectral method exploits the natural eigenfunctions of the master equation of birth-death processes to solve for the joint distribution of modules within the network, which then inform each other and facilitate calculation of the entire joint distribution. We illustrate the method on a ubiquitous case in nature: linear regulatory cascades. The efficiency of the method makes possible numerical optimization of the input and regulatory parameters, revealing design properties of, e.g., the most informative cascades. We find, for threshold regulation, that a cascade of strong regulations converts a unimodal input to a bimodal output, that multimodal inputs are no more informative than bimodal inputs, and that a chain of up-regulations outperforms a chain of down-regulations. We anticipate that this numerical approach may be useful for modeling noise in a variety of small network topologies in biology.},

abstract = {The establishment of complex expression patterns at precise times and locations is key to metazoan development, yet a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transcription control networks is still missing. Here we describe a novel thermodynamic model that computes expression patterns as a function of cis-regulatory sequence and of the binding-site preferences and expression of participating transcription factors. We apply this model to the segmentation gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and find that it predicts expression patterns of cis-regulatory modules with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution. Our analysis reveals that both strong and weaker binding sites contribute, leading to high occupancy of the module DNA, and conferring robustness against mutation; short-range homotypic clustering of weaker sites facilitates cooperative binding, which is necessary to sharpen the patterns. Our computational framework is generally applicable to most protein-DNA interaction systems.},

abstract = {Patients presenting with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children, have a very poor clinical prognosis. This is due, in large part, to our rudimentary knowledge of the molecular events that dictate metastatic potential. We used cDNA microarray analysis of RMS cell lines, derived from Ink4a/Arf-deficient mice transgenic for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), to identify a set of genes whose expression was significantly different between highly and poorly metastatic cells. Subsequent in vivo functional studies revealed that the actin filament-plasma membrane linker ezrin (encoded by Vil2) and the homeodomain-containing transcription factor Six-1 (sine oculis-related homeobox-1 homolog) had essential roles in determining the metastatic fate of RMS cells. VIL2 and SIX1 expression was enhanced in human RMS tissue, significantly correlating with clinical stage. The identification of ezrin and Six-1 as critical regulators of metastasis in RMS provides new mechanistic and therapeutic insights into this pediatric cancer.},

title = {Genetic programs constructed from layered logic gates in single cells},
abstract = {Genetic programs function to integrate environmental sensors, implement signal processing algorithms and control expression dynamics. These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits, and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits. Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed. This work demonstrates the successful layering of orthogonal logic gates, a design strategy that could enable the construction of large, integrated circuits in single cells.},

abstract = {Genomes of complex organisms encode an abundance and diversity of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are expressed throughout the cell and fulfill a wide variety of regulatory roles at almost every stage of gene expression. These roles, which encompass sensory, guiding, scaffolding and allosteric capacities, derive from folded modular domains in lncRNAs. In this diverse functional repertoire, we focus on the well-characterized ability for lncRNAs to function as epigenetic modulators. Many lncRNAs bind to chromatin-modifying proteins and recruit their catalytic activity to specific sites in the genome, thereby modulating chromatin states and impacting gene expression. Considering this regulatory potential in combination with the abundance of lncRNAs suggests that lncRNAs may be part of a broad epigenetic regulatory network.},

abstract = {Alu repeats are the most abundant family of repeats in the human genome, with over 1 million copies comprising 10% of the genome. They have been implicated in human genetic disease and in the enrichment of gene-rich segmental duplications in the human genome, and they form a rich fossil record of primate and human history. Alu repeat elements are believed to have arisen from the replication of a small number of source elements, whose evolution over time gives rise to the 31 Alu subfamilies currently reported in Repbase Update. We apply a novel method to identify and statistically validate 213 Alu subfamilies. We build an evolutionary tree of these subfamilies and conclude that the history of Alu evolution is more complex than previous studies had indicated.},

title = {A biophysical approach to transcription factor binding site discovery},
abstract = {Identification of transcription factor binding sites within regulatory segments of genomic DNA is an important step toward understanding of the regulatory circuits that control expression of genes. Here, we describe a novel bioinformatics method that bases classification of potential binding sites explicitly on the estimate of sequence-specific binding energy of a given transcription factor. The method also estimates the chemical potential of the factor that defines the threshold of binding. In contrast with the widely used information-theoretic weight matrix method, the new approach correctly describes saturation in the transcription factor/DNA binding probability. This results in a significant improvement in the number of expected false positives, particularly in the ubiquitous case of low-specificity factors. In the strong binding limit, the algorithm is related to the "support vector machine" approach to pattern recognition. The new method is used to identify likely genomic binding sites for the E. coli transcription factors collected in the DPInteract database. In addition, for CRP (a global regulatory factor), the likely regulatory modality (i.e., repressor or activator) of predicted binding sites is determined.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The relations between the promoter sequences and their strengths were extensively studied in the 1980s. Although these studies uncovered strong sequence-strength correlations, the cost of their elaborate experimental methods have been too high to be applied to a large number of promoters. On the contrary, a recent increase in the microarray data allows us to compare thousands of gene expressions with their DNA sequences. RESULTS: We studied the relations between the promoter sequences and their strengths using the Escherichia coli microarray data. We modeled those relations using a simple weight matrix, which was optimized with a novel support vector regression method. It was observed that several non-consensus bases in the '-35' and '-10' regions of promoter sequences act positively on the promoter strength and that certain consensus bases have a minor effect on the strength. We analyzed outliers for which the observed gene expressions deviate from the promoter strength predictions, and identified several genes with enhanced expressions due to multiple promoters and genes under strong regulation by transcription factors. Our method is applicable to other procaryotes for which both the promoter sequences and the microarray data are available.},

title = {Optimizing information flow in small genetic networks},
abstract = {In order to survive, reproduce, and (in multicellular organisms) differentiate, cells must control the concentrations of the myriad different proteins that are encoded in the genome. The precision of this control is limited by the inevitable randomness of individual molecular events. Here we explore how cells can maximize their control power in the presence of these physical limits; formally, we solve the theoretical problem of maximizing the information transferred from inputs to outputs when the number of available molecules is held fixed. We start with the simplest version of the problem, in which a single transcription factor protein controls the readout of one or more genes by binding to DNA. We further simplify by assuming that this regulatory network operates in steady state, that the noise is small relative to the available dynamic range, and that the target genes do not interact. Even in this simple limit, we find a surprisingly rich set of optimal solutions. Importantly, for each locally optimal regulatory network, all parameters are determined once the physical constraints on the number of available molecules are specified. Although we are solving an oversimplified version of the problem facing real cells, we see parallels between the structure of these optimal solutions and the behavior of actual genetic regulatory networks. Subsequent papers will discuss more complete versions of the problem.},

abstract = {The protein energy landscape theory is used to obtain optimal energy functions for protein structure prediction via simulated annealing. The analysis here takes advantage of a more complete statistical characterization of the protein energy landscape and thereby improves on previous approximations. This schema partially takes into account correlations in the energy landscape. It also incorporates the relationships between folding dynamics and characteristic energy scales that control the collapse of the proteins and modulate rigidity of short-range interactions. Simulated annealing for the optimal energy functions, which are associative memory hamiltonians using a database of folding patterns, generally leads to quantitatively correct structures. In some cases the algorithm achieves "creativity," i.e., structures result that are better than any homolog in the database.},

abstract = {Model selection is the problem of distinguishing competing models, perhaps featuring different numbers of parameters. The statistics literature contains two distinct sets of tools, those based on information theory such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and those on Bayesian inference such as the Bayesian evidence and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The Deviance Information Criterion combines ideas from both heritages; it is readily computed from Monte Carlo posterior samples and, unlike the AIC and BIC, allows for parameter degeneracy. I describe the properties of the information criteria, and as an example compute them from WMAP3 data for several cosmological models. I find that at present the information theory and Bayesian approaches give significantly different conclusions from that data.},

title = {Embryonic and fetal limb myogenic cells are derived from developmentally distinct progenitors and have different requirements for beta-catenin},
abstract = {Vertebrate muscle arises sequentially from embryonic, fetal, and adult myoblasts. Although functionally distinct, it is unclear whether these myoblast classes develop from common or different progenitors. Pax3 and Pax7 are expressed by somitic myogenic progenitors and are critical myogenic determinants. To test the developmental origin of embryonic and fetal myogenic cells in the limb, we genetically labeled and ablated Pax3(+) and Pax7(+) cells. Pax3(+)Pax7(-) cells contribute to muscle and endothelium, establish and are required for embryonic myogenesis, and give rise to Pax7(+) cells. Subsequently, Pax7(+) cells give rise to and are required for fetal myogenesis. Thus, Pax3(+) and Pax7(+) cells contribute differentially to embryonic and fetal limb myogenesis. To investigate whether embryonic and fetal limb myogenic cells have different genetic requirements we conditionally inactivated or activated beta-catenin, an important regulator of myogenesis, in Pax3- or Pax7-derived cells. beta-Catenin is necessary within the somite for dermomyotome and myotome formation and delamination of limb myogenic progenitors. In the limb, beta-catenin is not required for embryonic myoblast specification or myofiber differentiation but is critical for determining fetal progenitor number and myofiber number and type. Together, these studies demonstrate that limb embryonic and fetal myogenic cells develop from distinct, but related progenitors and have different cell-autonomous requirements for beta-catenin.},

title = {Identification of direct residue contacts in protein-protein interaction by message passing},
abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

abstract = {The establishment of complex expression patterns at precise times and locations is key to metazoan development, yet a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transcription control networks is still missing. Here we describe a novel thermodynamic model that computes expression patterns as a function of cis-regulatory sequence and of the binding-site preferences and expression of participating transcription factors. We apply this model to the segmentation gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and find that it predicts expression patterns of cis-regulatory modules with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution. Our analysis reveals that both strong and weaker binding sites contribute, leading to high occupancy of the module DNA, and conferring robustness against mutation; short-range homotypic clustering of weaker sites facilitates cooperative binding, which is necessary to sharpen the patterns. Our computational framework is generally applicable to most protein-DNA interaction systems.},

abstract = {Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

title = {Periodic notch inhibition by lunatic fringe underlies the chick segmentation clock},
abstract = {The segmented aspect of the vertebrate body plan first arises through the sequential formation of somites. The periodicity of somitogenesis is thought to be regulated by a molecular oscillator, the segmentation clock, which functions in presomitic mesoderm cells. This oscillator controls the periodic expression of 'cyclic genes', which are all related to the Notch pathway. The mechanism underlying this oscillator is not understood. Here we show that the protein product of the cyclic gene lunatic fringe (Lfng), which encodes a glycosyltransferase that can modify Notch activity, oscillates in the chick presomitic mesoderm. Overexpressing Lfng in the paraxial mesoderm abolishes the expression of cyclic genes including endogenous Lfng and leads to defects in segmentation. This effect on cyclic genes phenocopies inhibition of Notch signalling in the presomitic mesoderm. We therefore propose that Lfng establishes a negative feedback loop that implements periodic inhibition of Notch, which in turn controls the rhythmic expression of cyclic genes in the chick presomitic mesoderm. This feedback loop provides a molecular basis for the oscillator underlying the avian segmentation clock.},

title = {DNA-Binding Specificities of Human Transcription Factors},
abstract = {Although the proteins that read the gene regulatory code, transcription factors (TFs), have been largely identified, it is not well known which sequences TFs can recognize. We have analyzed the sequence-specific binding of human TFs using high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing. A total of 830 binding profiles were obtained, describing 239 distinctly different binding specificities. The models represent the majority of human TFs, approximately doubling the coverage compared to existing systematic studies. Our results reveal additional specificity determinants for a large number of factors for which a partial specificity was known, including a commonly observed A- or T-rich stretch that flanks the core motifs. Global analysis of the data revealed that homodimer orientation and spacing preferences, and base-stacking interactions, have a larger role in TF-DNA binding than previously appreciated. We further describe a binding model incorporating these features that is required to understand binding of TFs to DNA.},

title = {Spectral solutions to stochastic models of gene expression with bursts and regulation},
abstract = {Signal-processing molecules inside cells are often present at low copy number, which necessitates probabilistic models to account for intrinsic noise. Probability distributions have traditionally been found using simulation-based approaches which then require estimating the distributions from many samples. Here we present in detail an alternative method for directly calculating a probability distribution by expanding in the natural eigenfunctions of the governing equation, which is linear. We apply the resulting spectral method to three general models of stochastic gene expression: a single gene with multiple expression states (often used as a model of bursting in the limit of two states), a gene regulatory cascade, and a combined model of bursting and regulation. In all cases we find either analytic results or numerical prescriptions that greatly outperform simulations in efficiency and accuracy. In the last case, we show that bimodal response in the limit of slow switching is not only possible but optimal in terms of information transmission.},

abstract = {We have identified a novel subfamily of mammalian hairy/Enhancer of split (E(spl))-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes together with a putative Drosophila homologue. While hairy/E(spl) proteins are characterized by an invariant proline residue in the basic domain and a carboxyterminal groucho-binding WRPW motif, our genes encode a carboxyterminal KPYRPWG sequence and were thus designated as Hey genes (Hairy/E(spl)-related with YRPW motif). Furthermore, they bear a unique C-terminal TE(I/V)GAF motif and the characteristic proline is changed in all Hey family members to glycine. RNA in situ hybridization analysis revealed specific expression of Hey1 during development of the nervous system, the somites, the heart and the craniofacial region. Hey2 is similarly expressed in the somites whereas it shows a complementary expression in the heart, the craniofacial region and the nervous system. The diversity of expression patterns implies unique functions in neurogenesis, somitogenesis and organogenesis.},

title = {Additivity in protein-DNA interactions: how good an approximation is it?},
abstract = {Man and Stormo and Bulyk et al. recently presented their results on the study of the DNA binding affinity of proteins. In both of these studies the main conclusion is that the additivity assumption, usually applied in methods to search for binding sites, is not true. In the first study, the analysis of binding affinity data from the Mnt repressor protein bound to all possible DNA (sub)targets at positions 16 and 17 of the binding site, showed that those positions are not independent. In the second study, the authors analysed DNA binding affinity data of the wild-type mouse EGR1 protein and four variants differing on the middle finger. The binding affinity of these proteins was measured to all 64 possible trinucleotide (sub)targets of the middle finger using microarray technology. The analysis of the measurements also showed interdependence among the positions in the DNA target. In the present report, we review the data of both studies and we re- analyse them using various statistical methods, including a comparison with a multiple regression approach. We conclude that despite the fact that the additivity assumption does not fit the data perfectly, in most cases it provides a very good approximation of the true nature of the specific protein-DNA interactions. Therefore, additive models can be very useful for the discovery and prediction of binding sites in genomic DNA.},

abstract = {Modularity is an attribute of a system that can be decomposed into a set of cohesive entities that are loosely coupled. Many cellular networks can be decomposed into functional modules-each functionally separable from the other modules. The protein complexes in physical protein interaction networks are a good example of this, and here we focus on their origins and evolution. We investigate the emergence of protein complexes and physical interactions between proteins by duplication, and review other mechanisms. We dissect the dataset of protein complexes of known three-dimensional structure, and show that roughly 90% of these complexes contain contacts between identical proteins within the same complex. Proteins that are shared across different complexes occur frequently, and they tend to be essential genes more often than members of a single protein complex. We also provide a perspective on the evolutionary mechanisms driving the growth of other modular cellular networks such as transcriptional regulatory and metabolic networks.},

title = {A system for enhancing genome-wide coexpression dynamics study},
abstract = {Statistical similarity analysis has been instrumental in elucidation of the voluminous microarray data. Genes with correlated expression profiles tend to be functionally associated. However, the majority of functionally associated genes turn out to be uncorrelated. One conceivable reason is that the expression of a gene can be sensitively dependent on the often-varying cellular state. The intrinsic state change has to be plastically accommodated by gene-regulatory mechanisms. To capture such dynamic coexpression between genes, a concept termed "liquid association" (LA) has been introduced recently. LA offers a scoring system to guide a genome-wide search for critical cellular players that may interfere with the coexpression of a pair of genes, thereby weakening their overall correlation. Although the LA method works in many cases, a direct extension to more than two genes is hindered by the "curse of dimensionality." Here we introduce a strategy of finding an informative 2D projection to generalize LA for multiple genes. A web site is constructed that performs on-line LA computation for any user-specified group of genes. We apply this scoring system to study yeast protein complexes by using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein complexes database of the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences. Human genes are also investigated by profiling of 60 cancer cell lines of the National Cancer Institute. In particular, our system links the expression of the Alzheimer's disease hallmark gene APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) to the beta-site-cleaving enzymes BACE and BACE2, the gamma-site-cleaving enzymes presenilin 1 and 2, apolipoprotein E, and other Alzheimer's disease-related genes.},

title = {Genome-wide identification of cis-regulatory motifs and modules underlying gene coregulation using statistics and phylogeny},
abstract = {Cell fate determination depends in part on the establishment of specific transcriptional programs of gene expression. These programs result from the interpretation of the genomic cis-regulatory information by sequence-specific factors. Decoding this information in sequenced genomes is an important issue. Here, we developed statistical analysis tools to computationally identify the cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression in a set of coregulated genes. Starting with a small number of validated and/or predicted cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a reference species as a training set, but with no a priori knowledge of the factors acting in trans, we computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and genomic CRMs underlying coregulation. This method was applied to the gene expression program active in Drosophila melanogaster sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs), a specific type of neural progenitor cells. Mutational analysis showed that four, including one newly characterized, out of the five top-ranked families of predicted TFBSs were required for SOP-specific gene expression. Additionaly, 19 out of the 29 top-ranked predicted CRMs directed gene expression in neural progenitor cells, i.e., SOPs or larval brain neuroblasts, with a notable fraction active in SOPs (11/29). We further identified the lola gene as the target of two SOP-specific CRMs and found that the lola gene contributed to SOP specification. The statistics and phylogeny-based tools described here can be more generally applied to identify the cis-regulatory elements of specific gene regulatory networks in any family of related species with sequenced genomes.},

abstract = {Satellite cells are a population of adult muscle stem cells that play a key role in mediating muscle regeneration. Activation of these quiescent stem cells in response to muscle injury involves modulating expression of multiple developmentally regulated genes, including mediators of the muscle-specific transcription program: Pax7, Myf5, MyoD and myogenin. Here we present evidence suggesting an essential role for the antagonistic Polycomb group and Trithorax group proteins in the epigenetic marking of muscle-specific genes to ensure proper temporal and spatial expression during muscle regeneration. The importance of Polycomb group and Trithorax group proteins in establishing chromatin structure at muscle-specific genes suggests that therapeutic modulation of their activity in satellite cells could represent a viable approach for repairing damaged muscle in muscular dystrophy.},

title = {Collective behavior in animal groups: theoretical models and empirical studies},
abstract = {Collective phenomena in animal groups have attracted much attention in the last years, becoming one of the hottest topics in ethology. There are various reasons for this. On the one hand, animal grouping provides a paradigmatic example of self-organization, where collective behavior emerges in absence of centralized control. The mechanism of group formation, where local rules for the individuals lead to a coherent global state, is very general and transcends the detailed nature of its components. In this respect, collective animal behavior is a subject of great interdisciplinary interest. On the other hand, there are several important issues related to the biological function of grouping and its evolutionary success. Research in this field boasts a number of theoretical models, but much less empirical results to compare with. For this reason, even if the general mechanisms through which self-organization is achieved are qualitatively well understood, a quantitative test of the models assumptions is still lacking. New analysis on large groups, which require sophisticated technological procedures, can provide the necessary empirical data.},

title = {Mobile elements create structural variation: analysis of a complete human genome},
abstract = {Structural variants (SVs) are common in the human genome. Because approximately half of the human genome consists of repetitive, transposable DNA sequences, it is plausible that these elements play an important role in generating SVs in humans. Sequencing of the diploid genome of one individual human (HuRef) affords us the opportunity to assess, for the first time, the impact of mobile elements on SVs in an individual in a thorough and unbiased fashion. In this study, we systematically evaluated more than 8000 SVs to identify mobile element-associated SVs as small as 100 bp and specific to the HuRef genome. Combining computational and experimental analyses, we identified and validated 706 mobile element insertion events (including Alu, L1, SVA elements, and nonclassical insertions), which added more than 305 kb of new DNA sequence to the HuRef genome compared with the Human Genome Project (HGP) reference sequence (hg18). We also identified 140 mobile element-associated deletions, which removed approximately 126 kb of sequence from the HuRef genome. Overall, approximately 10% of the HuRef-specific indels larger than 100 bp are caused by mobile element-associated events. More than one-third of the insertion/deletion events occurred in genic regions, and new Alu insertions occurred in exons of three human genes. Based on the number of insertions and the estimated time to the most recent common ancestor of HuRef and the HGP reference genome, we estimated the Alu, L1, and SVA retrotransposition rates to be one in 21 births, 212 births, and 916 births, respectively. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of mobile element-related structural variants in the complete DNA sequence of an individual and demonstrates that mobile elements play an important role in generating inter-individual structural variation.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal expression of specific basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors defines many types of cellular differentiation. We find that a distinct mechanism regulates the much broader expression of the heterodimer partners of these specific factors and impinges on differentiation. In Drosophila, a cross-interacting regulatory network links expression of the E protein Daughterless (Da), which heterodimerizes with bHLH proteins to activate them, with expression of the Id protein Extramacrochaetae (Emc), which antagonizes bHLH proteins. Coupled transcriptional feedback loops maintain the widespread Emc expression that restrains Da expression, opposing bHLH-dependent differentiation while enhancing growth and cell survival. Where extracellular signals repress emc, Da expression can increase. This defines regions of proneural ectoderm independently from the proneural bHLH genes. Similar regulation is found in multiple Drosophila tissues and in mammalian cells and therefore is likely to be a conserved general feature of developmental regulation by HLH proteins.},

It is argued that lack of clarity in the formulation of basic philosophical questions leads to unnecessary obscurity and controversy and an attempt is made to identify the main forks in the road that separate the most important interpretations of quantum theory. The consistent histories formulation, also known as "consistent quantum theory", is described as one particular way (favored by the author) to answer the essential questions of interpretation. The theory is shown to be a realistic formulation of quantum mechanics, in contrast to the orthodox or Copenhagen formulation which will be referred to as an operationalist theory.},

abstract = {Specification of endoderm is the prerequisite for gut formation in the embryogenesis of bilaterian organisms. Modern lineage labelling studies have shown that in the sea urchin embryo model system, descendants of the veg1 and veg2 cell lineages produce the endoderm, and that the veg2 lineage also gives rise to mesodermal cell types. It is known that Wnt/β-catenin signalling is required for endoderm specification and Delta/Notch signalling is required for mesoderm specification. Some direct cis-regulatory targets of these signals have been found and various phenomenological patterns of gene expression have been observed in the pre-gastrular endomesoderm. However, no comprehensive, causal explanation of endoderm specification has been conceived for sea urchins, nor for any other deuterostome. Here we propose a model, on the basis of the underlying genomic control system, that provides such an explanation, built at several levels of biological organization. The hardwired core of the control system consists of the cis-regulatory apparatus of endodermal regulatory genes, which determine the relationship between the inputs to which these genes are exposed and their outputs. The architecture of the network circuitry controlling the dynamic process of endoderm specification then explains, at the system level, a sequence of developmental logic operations, which generate the biological process. The control system initiates non-interacting endodermal and mesodermal gene regulatory networks in veg2-derived cells and extinguishes the endodermal gene regulatory network in mesodermal precursors. It also generates a cross-regulatory network that specifies future anterior endoderm in veg2 descendants and institutes a distinct network specifying posterior endoderm in veg1-derived cells. The network model provides an explanatory framework that relates endoderm specification to the genomic regulatory code.},

Identifying the specific sequences that each factor binds can help to elucidate regulatory networks within cells and how genetic variation can cause disruption of normal gene expression, which is often associated with disease. Traditional methods for determining the specificity of DNA-binding proteins are slow and laborious, but several new high-throughput methods can provide comprehensive binding information much more rapidly. Combined with in vivo determinations of transcription factor binding locations, this information provides more detailed views of the regulatory circuitry of cells and the effects of variation on gene expression.},

title = {Phylogenetic determination of the pace of transposable element proliferation in plants: copia and LINE-like elements in Gossypium},
abstract = {Transposable elements contribute significantly to plant genome evolution in myriad ways, ranging from local insertional mutations to global effects exerted on genome size through accumulation. Differential accumulation and deletion of transposable elements may profoundly affect genome size, even among members of the same genus. One example is that of Gossypium (cotton), where much of the 3-fold genome size variation is due to differential accumulation of one gypsy-like LTR retrotransposon, Gorge3. Copia and non-LTR LINE retrotransposons are also major components of the Gossypium genome, but unlike Gorge3, their extant copy numbers do not correlate with genome size. In the present study, we describe the nature and timing of transposition for copia and LINE retrotransposons in Gossypium. Our findings indicate that copia retrotransposons have been active in each lineage since divergence from a common ancestor, and that they have proliferated in a punctuated manner. However, the evolutionary history of LINEs contrasts markedly with that of the copia retrotransposons. Although LINEs have also been active in each lineage, they have accumulated in a stochastically regular manner, and phylogenetic analysis suggests that extant LINE populations in Gossypium are dominated by ancient insertions. Interestingly, the magnitude of transpositional bursts in each lineage corresponds directly with extant estimated copy number.},

title = {GAPWM: a genetic algorithm method for optimizing a position weight matrix},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Position weight matrices (PMWs) are simple models commonly used in motif-finding algorithms to identify short functional elements, such as cis-regulatory motifs, on genes. When few experimentally verified motifs are available, estimation of the PWM may be poor. The resultant PWM may not reliably discriminate a true motif from a false one. While experimentally identifying such motifs remains time-consuming and expensive, low-resolution binding data from techniques such as ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-PET have become available. We propose a novel but simple method to improve a poorly estimated PWM using ChIP data. METHODOLOGY: Starting from an existing PWM, a set of ChIP sequences, and a set of background sequences, our method, GAPWM, derives an improved PWM via a genetic algorithm that maximizes the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. GAPWM can easily incorporate prior information such as base conservation. We tested our method on two PMWs (Oct4/Sox2 and p53) using three recently published ChIP data sets (human Oct4, mouse Oct4 and human p53). RESULTS: GAPWM substantially increased the sensitivity/specificity of a poorly estimated PWM and further improved the quality of a good PWM. Furthermore, it still functioned when the starting PWM contained a major error. The ROC performance of GAPWM compared favorably with that of MEME and others. With increasing availability of ChIP data, our method provides an alternative for obtaining high-quality PWMs for genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding sites. AVAILABILITY: The C source code and all data used in this report are available at http://dir.niehs.nih.gov/dirbb/gapwm. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Living cells must control the reading out or "expression" of information encoded in their genomes, and this regulation often is mediated by transcription factors-proteins that bind to DNA and either enhance or repress the expression of nearby genes. But the expression of transcription factor proteins is itself regulated, and many transcription factors regulate their own expression in addition to responding to other input signals. Here we analyze the simplest of such self-regulatory circuits, asking how parameters can be chosen to optimize information transmission from inputs to outputs in the steady state. Some nonzero level of self-regulation is almost always optimal, with self-activation dominant when transcription factor concentrations are low and self-repression dominant when concentrations are high. In steady state the optimal self-activation is never strong enough to induce bistability, although there is a limit in which the optimal parameters are very close to the critical point.},

title = {Identification of direct residue contacts in protein-protein interaction by message passing},
abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

abstract = {Pax3 and Pax7 regulate stem cell function in skeletal myogenesis. However, molecular insight into their distinct roles has remained elusive. Using gene expression data combined with genome-wide binding-site analysis, we show that both Pax3 and Pax7 bind identical DNA motifs and jointly activate a large panel of genes involved in muscle stem cell function. Surprisingly, in adult myoblasts Pax3 binds a subset (6.4%) of Pax7 targets. Despite a significant overlap in their transcriptional network, Pax7 regulates distinct panels of genes involved in the promotion of proliferation and inhibition of myogenic differentiation. We show that Pax7 has a higher binding affinity to the homeodomain-binding motif relative to Pax3, suggesting that intrinsic differences in DNA binding contribute to the observed functional difference between Pax3 and Pax7 binding in myogenesis. Together, our data demonstrate distinct attributes of Pax7 function and provide mechanistic insight into the nonredundancy of Pax3 and Pax7 in muscle development.},

Such linkages suggest a concept for engineering allosteric control into proteins: The intramolecular networks of two proteins could be joined across their surface sites such that the activity of one protein might control the activity of the other. We tested this idea by creating PAS-DHFR, a designed chimeric protein that connects a light-sensing signaling domain from a plant member of the Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) family of proteins with Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). With no optimization, PAS-DHFR exhibited light-dependent catalytic activity that depended on the site of connection and on known signaling mechanisms in both proteins. PAS-DHFR serves as a proof of concept for engineering regulatory activities into proteins through interface design at conserved allosteric sites.},

By reconciling two approaches for analyzing correlations in multiple sequence alignments, we uncover a new class of coevolving units, called 'sectons'. Sectons provide a conceptual link between coevolving contacts and sectors. The methods and results that we present are general, and relevant beyond protein structures. This generality is illustrated with an analysis of the co-occurrence of orthologous genes in bacterial genomes.},

title = {Fine-scale transgenic mapping of the MyoD core enhancer: MyoD is regulated by distinct but overlapping mechanisms in myotomal and non-myotomal muscle lineages},
abstract = {Skeletal muscle lineage determination is regulated by the myogenic regulatory genes, MyoD and Myf-5. Previously, we identified a 258 bp core enhancer element 20 kb 5' of the MyoD gene that regulates MyoD gene activation in mouse embryos. To elucidate the cis control mechanisms that regulate MyoD transcription, we have mutagenized the entire core enhancer using linker-scanner mutagenesis, and have tested the transcriptional activity of enhancer mutants using lacZ reporter gene expression in transgenic mouse embryos. In total, 83 stable transgenic lines representing 17 linker-scanner mutations were analyzed in midgestational mouse embryos. Eight linker-scanner mutations resulted in a partial or complete loss of enhancer activity, demonstrating that MyoD is primarily under positive transcriptional control. Six of these mutations reduced or abolished transgene expression in all skeletal muscle lineages, indicating that activation of MyoD expression in trunk, limb and head musculature is regulated, in part, by shared transcriptional mechanisms. Interestingly, however, two adjacent linker-scanner mutations (LS-14 and LS-15) resulted in a dramatic reduction in transgene expression specifically in myotomes at 11.5 days. At later stages, transgene expression was absent or greatly reduced in myotomally derived muscles including epaxial muscles (deep back muscles) and hypaxial muscles of the body wall (intercostal muscles, abdominal wall musculature). In contrast, head muscles, as well as muscles of the body derived from migrating muscle progenitor cells (e.g. limb, diaphragm), were unaffected by these mutations. In Pax-3-mutant mice, LS-14 and LS-15 transgene expression was eliminated in the body, but was unaffected in the head, yielding an identical expression pattern to the endogenous MyoD gene in mice mutant for both Myf-5 and Pax-3. These data support the hypothesis that LS-14 and LS-15 define the core enhancer targets for Myf-5-dependent activation of MyoD in myotomal muscles.},

title = {UTX mediates demethylation of H3K27me3 at muscle-specific genes during myogenesis},
abstract = {Polycomb (PcG) and Trithorax (TrxG) group proteins act antagonistically to establish tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. The PcG protein Ezh2 facilitates repression by catalysing histone H3-Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). For expression, H3K27me3 marks are removed and replaced by TrxG protein catalysed histone H3-Lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Although H3K27 demethylases have been identified, the mechanism by which these enzymes are targeted to specific genomic regions to remove H3K27me3 marks has not been established. Here, we demonstrate a two-step mechanism for UTX-mediated demethylation at muscle-specific genes during myogenesis. Although the transactivator Six4 initially recruits UTX to the regulatory region of muscle genes, the resulting loss of H3K27me3 marks is limited to the region upstream of the transcriptional start site. Removal of the repressive H3K27me3 mark within the coding region then requires RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) elongation. Interestingly, blocking Pol II elongation on transcribed genes leads to increased H3K27me3 within the coding region, and formation of bivalent (H3K27me3/H3K4me3) chromatin domains. Thus, removal of repressive H3K27me3 marks by UTX occurs through targeted recruitment followed by spreading across the gene.},

abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

abstract = {Disruptions in local chromatin structure often indicate features of biological interest such as regulatory regions. We find that sonication of cross-linked chromatin, when combined with a size-selection step and massively parallel short-read sequencing, can be used as a method (Sono-Seq) to map locations of high chromatin accessibility in promoter regions. Sono-Seq sites frequently correspond to actively transcribed promoter regions, as evidenced by their co-association with RNA Polymerase II ChIP regions, transcription start sites, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks, and CpG islands; signals over other sites, such as those bound by the CTCF insulator, are also observed. The pattern of breakage by Sono-Seq overlaps with, but is distinct from, that observed for FAIRE and DNase I hypersensitive sites. Our results demonstrate that Sono-Seq can be a useful and simple method by which to map many local alterations in chromatin structure. Furthermore, our results provide insights into the mapping of binding sites by using ChIP-Seq experiments and the value of reference samples that should be used in such experiments.},

title = {Detecting the limits of regulatory element conservation and divergence estimation using pairwise and multiple alignments},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular evolutionary studies of noncoding sequences rely on multiple alignments. Yet how multiple alignment accuracy varies across sequence types, tree topologies, divergences and tools, and further how this variation impacts specific inferences, remains unclear. RESULTS: Here we develop a molecular evolution simulation platform, CisEvolver, with models of background noncoding and transcription factor binding site evolution, and use simulated alignments to systematically examine multiple alignment accuracy and its impact on two key molecular evolutionary inferences: transcription factor binding site conservation and divergence estimation. We find that the accuracy of multiple alignments is determined almost exclusively by the pairwise divergence distance of the two most diverged species and that additional species have a negligible influence on alignment accuracy. Conserved transcription factor binding sites align better than surrounding noncoding DNA yet are often found to be misaligned at relatively short divergence distances, such that studies of binding site gain and loss could easily be confounded by alignment error. Divergence estimates from multiple alignments tend to be overestimated at short divergence distances but reach a tool specific divergence at which they cease to increase, leading to underestimation at long divergences. Our most striking finding was that overall alignment accuracy, binding site alignment accuracy and divergence estimation accuracy vary greatly across branches in a tree and are most accurate for terminal branches connecting sister taxa and least accurate for internal branches connecting sub-alignments. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that variation in alignment accuracy can lead to errors in molecular evolutionary inferences that could be construed as biological variation. These findings have implications for which species to choose for analyses, what kind of errors would be expected for a given set of species and how multiple alignment tools and phylogenetic inference methods might be improved to minimize or control for alignment errors.},

title = {Designing sequential transcription logic: a simple genetic circuit for conditional memory},
abstract = {The ability to learn and respond to recurrent events depends on the capacity to remember transient biological signals received in the past. Moreover, it may be desirable to remember or ignore these transient signals conditioned upon other signals that are active at specific points in time or in unique environments. Here, we propose a simple genetic circuit in bacteria that is capable of conditionally memorizing a signal in the form of a transcription factor concentration. The circuit behaves similarly to a "data latch" in an electronic circuit, i.e. it reads and stores an input signal only when conditioned to do so by a "read command." Our circuit is of the same size as the well-known genetic toggle switch (an unconditional latch) which consists of two mutually repressing genes, but is complemented with a "regulatory front end" involving protein heterodimerization as a simple way to implement conditional control. Deterministic and stochastic analysis of the circuit dynamics indicate that an experimental implementation is feasible based on well-characterized genes and proteins. It is not known, to which extent molecular networks are able to conditionally store information in natural contexts for bacteria. However, our results suggest that such sequential logic elements may be readily implemented by cells through the combination of existing protein-protein interactions and simple transcriptional regulation.},

title = {Assessing the effects of symmetry on motif discovery and modeling},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying the DNA binding sites for transcription factors is a key task in modeling the gene regulatory network of a cell. Predicting DNA binding sites computationally suffers from high false positives and false negatives due to various contributing factors, including the inaccurate models for transcription factor specificity. One source of inaccuracy in the specificity models is the assumption of asymmetry for symmetric models.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using simulation studies, so that the correct binding site model is known and various parameters of the process can be systematically controlled, we test different motif finding algorithms on both symmetric and asymmetric binding site data. We show that if the true binding site is asymmetric the results are unambiguous and the asymmetric model is clearly superior to the symmetric model. But if the true binding specificity is symmetric commonly used methods can infer, incorrectly, that the motif is asymmetric. The resulting inaccurate motifs lead to lower sensitivity and specificity than would the correct, symmetric models. We also show how the correct model can be obtained by the use of appropriate measures of statistical significance.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that the most commonly used motif-finding approaches usually model symmetric motifs incorrectly, which leads to higher than necessary false prediction errors. It also demonstrates how alternative motif-finding methods can correct the problem, providing more accurate motif models and reducing the errors. Furthermore, it provides criteria for determining whether a symmetric or asymmetric model is the most appropriate for any experimental dataset.},

title = {Optimizing information flow in small genetic networks. II: Feed forward interactions},
abstract = {Central to the functioning of a living cell is its ability to control the readout or expression of information encoded in the genome. In many cases, a single transcription factor protein activates or represses the expression of many genes. As the concentration of the transcription factor varies, the target genes thus undergo correlated changes, and this redundancy limits the ability of the cell to transmit information about input signals. We explore how interactions among the target genes can reduce this redundancy and optimize information transmission. Our discussion builds on recent work [Tkacik et al, Phys Rev E 80, 031920 (2009)], and there are connections to much earlier work on the role of lateral inhibition in enhancing the efficiency of information transmission in neural circuits; for simplicity we consider here the case where the interactions have a feed forward structure, with no loops. Even with this limitation, the networks that optimize information transmission have a structure reminiscent of the networks found in real biological systems.},

title = {A deterministic map of Waddington's epigenetic landscape for cell fate specification},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The image of the "epigenetic landscape", with a series of branching valleys and ridges depicting stable cellular states and the barriers between those states, has been a popular visual metaphor for cell lineage specification - especially in light of the recent discovery that terminally differentiated adult cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells or into alternative cell lineages. However the question of whether the epigenetic landscape can be mapped out quantitatively to provide a predictive model of cellular differentiation remains largely unanswered.

RESULTS: Here we derive a simple deterministic path-integral quasi-potential, based on the kinetic parameters of a gene network regulating cell fate, and show that this quantity is minimized along a temporal trajectory in the state space of the gene network, thus providing a marker of directionality for cell differentiation processes. We then use the derived quasi-potential as a measure of "elevation" to quantitatively map the epigenetic landscape, on which trajectories flow "downhill" from any location. Stochastic simulations confirm that the elevation of this computed landscape correlates to the likelihood of occurrence of particular cell fates, with well-populated low-lying "valleys" representing stable cellular states and higher "ridges" acting as barriers to transitions between the stable states.

CONCLUSIONS: This quantitative map of the epigenetic landscape underlying cell fate choice provides mechanistic insights into the "forces" that direct cellular differentiation in the context of physiological development, as well as during artificially induced cell lineage reprogramming. Our generalized approach to mapping the landscape is applicable to non-gradient gene regulatory systems for which an analytical potential function cannot be derived, and also to high-dimensional gene networks. Rigorous quantification of the gene regulatory circuits that govern cell lineage choice and subsequent mapping of the epigenetic landscape can potentially help identify optimal routes of cell fate reprogramming.},

abstract = {We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

title = {Somitic origin of limb muscle satellite and side population cells},
abstract = {Repair of mature skeletal muscle is mediated by adult muscle progenitors. Satellite cells have long been recognized as playing a major role in muscle repair, whereas side population (SP) cells have more recently been identified as contributing to this process. The developmental source of these two progenitor populations has been considerably debated. We explicitly tested and quantified the contribution of embryonic somitic cells to these progenitor populations. Chick somitic cells were labeled by using replication-defective retroviruses or quail/chick chimeras, and mouse cells were labeled by crossing somite-specific, Pax3-derived Cre driver lines with a Cre-dependent reporter line. We show that the majority of, if not all, limb muscle satellite cells arise from cells expressing Pax3 specifically in the hypaxial somite and their migratory derivatives. We also find that a significant number of, but not all, limb muscle SP cells are derived from the hypaxial somite. Notably, the heterogeneity in the developmental origin of SP cells is reflected in their functional heterogeneity; somitically derived SP cells are intrinsically more myogenic than nonsomitically derived ones. Thus, we show that the somites, which supply embryonic and fetal myoblasts, are also an important source of highly myogenic adult muscle progenitors.},

title = {Rapid DNA loss as a counterbalance to genome expansion through retrotransposon proliferation in plants},
abstract = {Transposable elements, particularly LTR-retrotransposons, comprise the primary vehicle for genome size expansion in plants, while DNA removal through illegitimate recombination and intrastrand homologous recombination serve as the most important counteracting forces to plant genomic obesity. Despite extensive research, the relative impact of these opposing forces and hence the directionality of genome size change remains unknown. In Gossypium (cotton), the 3-fold genome size variation among diploids is due largely to copy number variation of the gypsy-like retrotransposon Gorge3. Here we combine comparative sequence analysis with a modeling approach to study the directionality of genome size change in Gossypium. We demonstrate that the rate of DNA removal in the smaller genomes is sufficient to reverse genome expansion through Gorge3 proliferation. These data indicate that rates of DNA loss can be highly variable even within a single plant genus, and that the known mechanisms of DNA loss can indeed reverse the march toward genomic obesity.},

abstract = {A balance between Six2-dependent self-renewal and canonical Wnt signaling-directed commitment regulates mammalian nephrogenesis. Intersectional studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional profiling identified direct target genes shared by each pathway within nephron progenitors. Wnt4 and Fgf8 are essential for progenitor commitment; cis-regulatory modules flanking each gene are cobound by Six2 and β-catenin and are dependent on conserved Lef/Tcf binding sites for activity. In vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that Six2 and Lef/Tcf factors form a regulatory complex that promotes progenitor maintenance while entry of β-catenin into this complex promotes nephrogenesis. Alternative transcriptional responses associated with Six2 and β-catenin cobinding events occur through non-Lef/Tcf DNA binding mechanisms, highlighting the regulatory complexity downstream of Wnt signaling in the developing mammalian kidney.},

In many cases regulatory elements can be located at distances up to several megabases from their target genes. Recent evidence shows that long-range control of gene expression can be mediated through direct physical interactions between genes and these regulatory elements. Such looping interactions can be detected using the chromosome conformation capture (3C) methodology. Although 3C is experimentally straightforward, to draw meaningful conclusions one must carefully design 3C experiments and implement the conscientious use of controls. The general guidelines presented here should help experimental design and minimize misinterpretation of 3C experiments.},

abstract = {Dissecting components of key transcriptional networks is essential for understanding complex developmental processes and phenotypes. Genetic studies have highlighted the role of members of the Mef2 family of transcription factors as essential regulators in myogenesis from flies to man. To understand how these transcription factors control diverse processes in muscle development, we have combined chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with gene expression profiling to obtain a temporal map of Mef2 activity during Drosophila embryonic development. This global approach revealed three temporal patterns of Mef2 enhancer binding, providing a glimpse of dynamic enhancer use within the context of a developing embryo. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of Mef2's activity at the level of DNA binding and suggest cooperativity with the bHLH protein Twist. The number and diversity of new direct target genes indicates a much broader role for Mef2, at all stages of myogenesis, than previously anticipated.},

title = {Cell competition, growth and size control in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc},
abstract = {We report here experiments aimed at understanding the connections between cell competition and growth in the Drosophila wing disc. The principal assay has been to generate discs containing marked cells that proliferate at different rates and to study their interactions and their contribution to the final structure. It is known that single clones of fast-dividing cells within a compartment may occupy the larger part of the compartment without affecting its size. This has suggested the existence of interactions involving cell competition between fast- and slow-dividing cells directed to accommodate the contribution of each cell to the final compartment. Here we show that indeed fast-dividing cells can outcompete slow-dividing ones in their proximity. However, we argue that this elimination is of little consequence because preventing apoptosis, and therefore cell competition, in those compartments does not affect the size of the clones or the size of the compartments. Our experiments indicate that cells within a compartment proliferate autonomously at their own rate. The contribution of each cell to the compartment is exclusively determined by its division rate within the frame of a size control mechanism that stops growth once the compartment has reached the final arresting size. This is supported by a computer simulation of the contribution of individual fast clones growing within a population of slower dividing cells and without interacting with them. The values predicted by the simulation are very close to those obtained experimentally.},

title = {Identification of regulatory regions which confer muscle-specific gene expression},
abstract = {For many newly sequenced genes, sequence analysis of the putative protein yields no clue on function. It would be beneficial to be able to identify in the genome the regulatory regions that confer temporal and spatial expression patterns for the uncharacterized genes. Additionally, it would be advantageous to identify regulatory regions within genes of known expression pattern without performing the costly and time consuming laboratory studies now required. To achieve these goals, the wealth of case studies performed over the past 15 years will have to be collected into predictive models of expression. Extensive studies of genes expressed in skeletal muscle have identified specific transcription factors which bind to regulatory elements to control gene expression. However, potential binding sites for these factors occur with sufficient frequency that it is rare for a gene to be found without one. Analysis of experimentally determined muscle regulatory sequences indicates that muscle expression requires multiple elements in close proximity. A model is generated with predictive capability for identifying these muscle-specific regulatory modules. Phylogenetic footprinting, the identification of sequences conserved between distantly related species, complements the statistical predictions. Through the use of logistic regression analysis, the model promises to be easily modified to take advantage of the elucidation of additional factors, cooperation rules, and spacing constraints.},

title = {Statistical inference of the generation probability of T-cell receptors from sequence repertoires},
abstract = {Stochastic rearrangement of germline V-, D-, and J-genes to create variable coding sequence for certain cell surface receptors is at the origin of immune system diversity. This process, known as "VDJ recombination", is implemented via a series of stochastic molecular events involving gene choices and random nucleotide insertions between, and deletions from, genes. We use large sequence repertoires of the variable CDR3 region of human CD4+ T-cell receptor beta chains to infer the statistical properties of these basic biochemical events. Because any given CDR3 sequence can be produced in multiple ways, the probability distribution of hidden recombination events cannot be inferred directly from the observed sequences; we therefore develop a maximum likelihood inference method to achieve this end. To separate the properties of the molecular rearrangement mechanism from the effects of selection, we focus on nonproductive CDR3 sequences in T-cell DNA. We infer the joint distribution of the various generative events that occur when a new T-cell receptor gene is created. We find a rich picture of correlation (and absence thereof), providing insight into the molecular mechanisms involved. The generative event statistics are consistent between individuals, suggesting a universal biochemical process. Our probabilistic model predicts the generation probability of any specific CDR3 sequence by the primitive recombination process, allowing us to quantify the potential diversity of the T-cell repertoire and to understand why some sequences are shared between individuals. We argue that the use of formal statistical inference methods, of the kind presented in this paper, will be essential for quantitative understanding of the generation and evolution of diversity in the adaptive immune system.},

title = {Evolutionary inference via the Poisson Indel Process},
abstract = {We address the problem of the joint statistical inference of phylogenetic trees and multiple sequence alignments from unaligned molecular sequences. This problem is generally formulated in terms of string-valued evolutionary processes along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. The classic evolutionary process, the TKF91 model [Thorne JL, Kishino H, Felsenstein J (1991) J Mol Evol 33(2):114-124] is a continuous-time Markov chain model composed of insertion, deletion, and substitution events. Unfortunately, this model gives rise to an intractable computational problem: The computation of the marginal likelihood under the TKF91 model is exponential in the number of taxa. In this work, we present a stochastic process, the Poisson Indel Process (PIP), in which the complexity of this computation is reduced to linear. The Poisson Indel Process is closely related to the TKF91 model, differing only in its treatment of insertions, but it has a global characterization as a Poisson process on the phylogeny. Standard results for Poisson processes allow key computations to be decoupled, which yields the favorable computational profile of inference under the PIP model. We present illustrative experiments in which Bayesian inference under the PIP model is compared with separate inference of phylogenies and alignments.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that synaptic modifications underlie learning and memory. However, few studies have examined what can be deduced about the learning process from the distribution of synaptic weights. We analyze the perceptron, a prototypical feedforward neural network, and obtain the optimal synaptic weight distribution for a perceptron with excitatory synapses. It contains more than 50% silent synapses, and this fraction increases with storage reliability: silent synapses are therefore a necessary byproduct of optimizing learning and reliability. Exploiting the classical analogy between the perceptron and the cerebellar Purkinje cell, we fitted the optimal weight distribution to that measured for granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses. The two distributions agreed well, suggesting that the Purkinje cell can learn up to 5 kilobytes of information, in the form of 40,000 input-output associations.},

title = {Identification of muscle-specific regulatory modules in Caenorhabditis elegans},
abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is the major regulatory mechanism that controls the spatial and temporal expression of genes during development. This is carried out by transcription factors (TFs), which recognize and bind to their cognate binding sites. Recent studies suggest a modular organization of TF-binding sites, in which clusters of transcription-factor binding sites cooperate in the regulation of downstream gene expression. In this study, we report our computational identification and experimental verification of muscle-specific cis-regulatory modules in Caenorhabditis elegans. We first identified a set of motifs that are correlated with muscle-specific gene expression. We then predicted muscle-specific regulatory modules based on clusters of those motifs with characteristics similar to a collection of well-studied modules in other species. The method correctly identifies 88% of the experimentally characterized modules with a positive predictive value of at least 65%. The prediction accuracy of muscle-specific expression on an independent test set is highly significant (P<0.0001). We performed in vivo experimental tests of 12 predicted modules, and 10 of those drive muscle-specific gene expression. These results suggest that our method is highly accurate in identifying functional sequences important for muscle-specific gene expression and is a valuable tool for guiding experimental designs.},

The specificity of most TFs is currently modeled using position weight matrices (PWMs) that assume the positions within a binding site contribute independently to binding affinity for any site. Extensive, high-throughput quantitative binding assays let us examine, for the first time, the independence assumption for many TFs. We find that the specificity of most TFs is well fit with the simple PWM model, but in some cases more complex models are required. We introduce a binding energy model (BEM) that can include energy parameters for nonindependent contributions to binding affinity. We show that in most cases where a PWM is not sufficient, a BEM that includes energy parameters for adjacent dinucleotide contributions models the specificity very well. Having more accurate models of specificity greatly improves the interpretation of in vivo TF localization data, such as from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments.},

title = {Statistical alignment based on fragment insertion and deletion models},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The topic of this paper is the estimation of alignments and mutation rates based on stochastic sequence-evolution models that allow insertions and deletions of subsequences ('fragments') and not just single bases. The model we propose is a variant of a model introduced by Thorne et al., (J. Mol. Evol., 34, 3-16, 1992). The computational tractability of the model depends on certain restrictions in the insertion/deletion process; possible effects we discuss.

RESULTS: The process of fragment insertion and deletion in the sequence-evolution model induces a hidden Markov structure at the level of alignments and thus makes possible efficient statistical alignment algorithms. As an example we apply a sampling procedure to assess the variability in alignment and mutation parameter estimates for HVR1 sequences of human and orangutan, improving results of previous work. Simulation studies give evidence that estimation methods based on the proposed model also give satisfactory results when applied to data for which the restrictions in the insertion/deletion process do not hold.

title = {ChIP-seq accurately predicts tissue-specific activity of enhancers},
abstract = {A major yet unresolved quest in decoding the human genome is the identification of the regulatory sequences that control the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Distant-acting transcriptional enhancers are particularly challenging to uncover because they are scattered among the vast non-coding portion of the genome. Evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate the discovery of enhancers, but fails to predict when and where they are active in vivo. Here we present the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation with the enhancer-associated protein p300 followed by massively parallel sequencing, and map several thousand in vivo binding sites of p300 in mouse embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue. We tested 86 of these sequences in a transgenic mouse assay, which in nearly all cases demonstrated reproducible enhancer activity in the tissues that were predicted by p300 binding. Our results indicate that in vivo mapping of p300 binding is a highly accurate means for identifying enhancers and their associated activities, and suggest that such data sets will be useful to study the role of tissue-specific enhancers in human biology and disease on a genome-wide scale.},

title = {An alignment-free method to identify candidate orthologous enhancers in multiple Drosophila genomes},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Evolutionarily conserved non-coding genomic sequences represent a potentially rich source for the discovery of gene regulatory region such as transcriptional enhancers. However, detecting orthologous enhancers using alignment-based methods in higher eukaryotic genomes is particularly challenging, as regulatory regions can undergo considerable sequence changes while maintaining their functionality.

RESULTS: We have developed an alignment-free method which identifies conserved enhancers in multiple diverged species. Our method is based on similarity metrics between two sequences based on the co-occurrence of sequence patterns regardless of their order and orientation, thus tolerating sequence changes observed in non-coding evolution. We show that our method is highly successful in detecting orthologous enhancers in distantly related species without requiring additional information such as knowledge about transcription factors involved, or predicted binding sites. By estimating the significance of similarity scores, we are able to discriminate experimentally validated functional enhancers from seemingly equally conserved candidates without function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a wide range of enhancers in Drosophila, and also present encouraging results to detect conserved functional regions across large evolutionary distances. Our work provides encouraging steps on the way to ab initio unbiased enhancer prediction to complement ongoing experimental efforts.

title = {Structural basis of histidine kinase autophosphorylation deduced by integrating genomics, molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis},
abstract = {Signal transduction proteins such as bacterial sensor histidine kinases, designed to transition between multiple conformations, are often ruled by unstable transient interactions making structural characterization of all functional states difficult. This study explored the inactive and signal-activated conformational states of the two catalytic domains of sensor histidine kinases, HisKA and HATPase. Direct coupling analyses, a global statistical inference approach, was applied to >13,000 such domains from protein databases to identify residue contacts between the two domains. These contacts guided structural assembly of the domains using MAGMA, an advanced molecular dynamics docking method. The active conformation structure generated by MAGMA simultaneously accommodated the sequence derived residue contacts and the ATP-catalytic histidine contact. The validity of this structure was confirmed biologically by mutation of contact positions in the Bacillus subtilis sensor histidine kinase KinA and by restoration of activity in an inactive KinA(HisKA):KinD(HATPase) hybrid protein. These data indicate that signals binding to sensor domains activate sensor histidine kinases by causing localized strain and unwinding at the end of the C-terminal helix of the HisKA domain. This destabilizes the contact positions of the inactive conformation of the two domains, identified by previous crystal structure analyses and by the sequence analysis described here, inducing the formation of the active conformation. This study reveals that structures of unstable transient complexes of interacting proteins and of protein domains are accessible by applying this combination of cross-validating technologies.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that MyoD initiates a feed-forward regulation of skeletal muscle gene expression, predicting that MyoD binds directly to many genes expressed during differentiation. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing to identify genome-wide binding of MyoD in several skeletal muscle cell types. As anticipated, MyoD preferentially binds to a VCASCTG sequence that resembles the in vitro-selected site for a MyoD:E-protein heterodimer, and MyoD binding increases during differentiation at many of the regulatory regions of genes expressed in skeletal muscle. Unanticipated findings were that MyoD was constitutively bound to thousands of additional sites in both myoblasts and myotubes, and that the genome-wide binding of MyoD was associated with regional histone acetylation. Therefore, in addition to regulating muscle gene expression, MyoD binds genome wide and has the ability to broadly alter the epigenome in myoblasts and myotubes.},

abstract = {The study of the morphogenetic cell movements underlying myotome formation in the chick embryo has led to the emergence of highly controversial models. Here we report a real-time cell lineage analysis of myotome development using electroporation of a GFP reporter in newly formed chick somites. Confocal analysis of cell movements demonstrates that myotome formation involves two sequential steps. In a first phase, incremental myotome growth results from a contribution of myocytes derived solely from the medial border of the dermomyotome. In a second phase, myocytes are produced from all four borders of the dermomyotome. The relative distribution of myocytes demonstrates that the medial and the lateral borders of the somite generate exclusively epaxial and hypaxial muscles. This analysis also identified five myotomal regions, characterized by the origin of the myocytes that constitute them. Together, our results provide a comprehensive model describing the morphogenesis of the early myotome in higher vertebrates.},

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

title = {When are correlations strong?},
abstract = {The inverse problem of statistical mechanics involves finding the minimal Hamiltonian that is consistent with some observed set of correlation functions. This problem has received renewed interest in the analysis of biological networks; in particular, several such networks have been described successfully by maximum entropy models consistent with pairwise correlations. These correlations are usually weak in an absolute sense (e.g., correlation coefficients ~ 0.1 or less), and this is sometimes taken as evidence against the existence of interesting collective behavior in the network. If correlations are weak, it should be possible to capture their effects in perturbation theory, so we develop an expansion for the entropy of Ising systems in powers of the correlations, carrying this out to fourth order. We then consider recent work on networks of neurons [Schneidman et al., Nature 440, 1007 (2006); Tkacik et al., arXiv:0912.5409 [q-bio.NC] (2009)], and show that even though all pairwise correlations are weak, the fact that these correlations are widespread means that their impact on the network as a whole is not captured in the leading orders of perturbation theory. More positively, this means that recent successes of maximum entropy approaches are not simply the result of correlations being weak.},

abstract = {Nk-2 proteins are essential developmental regulators from flies to humans. In Drosophila, the family member tinman is the major regulator of cell fate within the dorsal mesoderm, including heart, visceral, and dorsal somatic muscle. To decipher Tinman's direct regulatory role, we performed a time course of ChIP-on-chip experiments, revealing a more prominent role in somatic muscle specification than previously anticipated. Through the combination of transgenic enhancer-reporter assays, colocalization studies, and phenotypic analyses, we uncovered two additional factors within this myogenic network: by activating eyes absent, Tinman's regulatory network extends beyond developmental stages and tissues where it is expressed; by regulating stat92E expression, Tinman modulates the transcriptional readout of JAK/STAT signaling. We show that this pathway is essential for somatic muscle development in Drosophila and for myotome morphogenesis in zebrafish. Taken together, these data uncover a conserved requirement for JAK/STAT signaling and an important component of the transcriptional network driving myogenesis.},

title = {Novel transcription regulatory elements in Caenorhabditis elegans muscle genes},
abstract = {We report the identification of three new transcription regulatory elements that are associated with muscle gene expression in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Starting from a subset of well-characterized nematode muscle genes, we identified conserved DNA motifs in the promoter regions using computational DNA pattern-recognition algorithms. These were considered to be putative muscle transcription regulatory motifs. Using the green-fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter, experiments were done to determine the biological activity of these motifs in driving muscle gene expression. Prediction accuracy of muscle expression based on the presence of these three motifs was encouraging; nine of 10 previously uncharacterized genes that were predicted to have muscle expression were shown to be expressed either specifically or selectively in the muscle tissues, whereas only one of the nine that scored low for these motifs expressed in muscle. Knockouts of putative regulatory elements in the promoter of the mlc-2 and unc-89 genes show that they significantly contribute to muscle expression and act in a synergistic manner. We find that these DNA motifs are also present in the muscle promoters of C. briggsae, indicating that they are functionally conserved in the nematodes.},

title = {The role of Hox genes during vertebrate limb development},
abstract = {The potential role of Hox genes during vertebrate limb development was brought into focus by gene expression analyses in mice (P Dolle, JC Izpisua-Belmonte, H Falkenstein, A Renucci, D Duboule, Nature 1989, 342:767-772), at a time when limb growth and patterning were thought to depend upon two distinct and rather independent systems of coordinates; one for the anterior-to-posterior axis and the other for the proximal-to-distal axis (see D Duboule, P Dolle, EMBO J 1989, 8:1497-1505). Over the past years, the function and regulation of these genes have been addressed using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in chick and mice. The use of multiple mutations either in cis-configuration in trans-configuration or in cis/trans configurations, has confirmed that Hox genes are essential for proper limb development, where they participate in both the growth and organization of the structures. Even though their molecular mechanisms of action remain somewhat elusive, the results of these extensive genetic analyses confirm that, during the development of the limbs, the various axes cannot be considered in isolation from each other and that a more holistic view of limb development should prevail over a simple cartesian, chess grid-like approach of these complex structures. With this in mind, the functional input of Hox genes during limb growth and development can now be re-assessed.},

abstract = {Recent work emphasizes that the maximum entropy principle provides a bridge between statistical mechanics models for collective behavior in neural networks and experiments on networks of real neurons. Most of this work has focused on capturing the measured correlations among pairs of neurons. Here we suggest an alternative, constructing models that are consistent with the distribution of global network activity, i.e. the probability that K out of N cells in the network generate action potentials in the same small time bin. The inverse problem that we need to solve in constructing the model is analytically tractable, and provides a natural "thermodynamics" for the network in the limit of large N. We analyze the responses of neurons in a small patch of the retina to naturalistic stimuli, and find that the implied thermodynamics is very close to an unusual critical point, in which the entropy (in proper units) is exactly equal to the energy.},

abstract = {It is now established that the transcription factors E2A, EBF1 and Foxo1 have critical roles in B cell development. Here we show that E2A and EBF1 bound regulatory elements present in the Foxo1 locus. E2A and EBF1, as well as E2A and Foxo1, in turn, were wired together by a vast spectrum of cis-regulatory sequences. These associations were dynamic during developmental progression. Occupancy by the E2A isoform E47 directly resulted in greater abundance, as well as a pattern of monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) across putative enhancer regions. Finally, we divided the pro-B cell epigenome into clusters of loci with occupancy by E2A, EBF and Foxo1. From this analysis we constructed a global network consisting of transcriptional regulators, signaling and survival factors that we propose orchestrates B cell fate.},

title = {Why most published research findings are false},
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

title = {The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulates Gli-mediated Myf5 expression during somitogenesis},
abstract = {Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates the activation of the myogenic determination gene Myf5 at the onset of myogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we report that the Wnt signal is transduced in muscle progenitor cells by at least two Frizzled (Fz) receptors (Fz1 and/or Fz6), through the canonical beta-catenin pathway, in the epaxial domain of newly formed somites. We show that Myf5 activation is dramatically reduced by blocking the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in somite progenitor cells, whereas expression of activated beta-catenin is sufficient to activate Myf5 in somites but not in the presomitic mesoderm. In addition, we identified Tcf/Lef sequences immediately 5' to the Myf5 early epaxial enhancer. These sites determine the correct spatiotemporal expression of Myf5 in the epaxial domain of the somite, mediating the synergistic action of the Wnt/beta-catenin and the Shh/Gli pathways. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Myf5 is a direct target of Wnt/beta-catenin, and that its full activation requires a cooperative interaction between the canonical Wnt and the Shh/Gli pathways in muscle progenitor cells.},

abstract = {The quantitative relation between transcription factor concentrations and the rate of protein production from downstream genes is central to the function of genetic networks. Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter P(R) in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

title = {Scale-free correlations in starling flocks},
abstract = {From bird flocks to fish schools, animal groups often seem to react to environmental perturbations as if of one mind. Most studies in collective animal behavior have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may emerge from simple behavioral rules. Less effort has been devoted to understanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a whole reacts to its environment. Yet, in the presence of strong predatory pressure on the group, collective response may yield a significant adaptive advantage. Here we suggest that collective response in animal groups may be achieved through scale-free behavioral correlations. By reconstructing the 3D position and velocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what extent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each other. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a constant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result indicates that behavioral correlations are scale free: The change in the behavioral state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other animals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations provide each animal with an effective perception range much larger than the direct interindividual interaction range, thus enhancing global response to perturbations. Our results suggest that flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to environmental perturbations.},

abstract = {Comprehensive identification of all functional elements encoded in the human genome is a fundamental need in biomedical research. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes to create a systematic catalogue of common regulatory motifs in promoters and 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs). The promoter analysis yields 174 candidate motifs, including most previously known transcription-factor binding sites and 105 new motifs. The 3'-UTR analysis yields 106 motifs likely to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Nearly one-half are associated with microRNAs (miRNAs), leading to the discovery of many new miRNA genes and their likely target genes. Our results suggest that previous estimates of the number of human miRNA genes were low, and that miRNAs regulate at least 20% of human genes. The overall results provide a systematic view of gene regulation in the human, which will be refined as additional mammalian genomes become available.},

title = {Wound healing recapitulates morphogenesis in Drosophila embryos},
abstract = {The capacity to repair a wound is a fundamental survival mechanism that is activated at any site of damage throughout embryonic and adult life. To study the cell biology and genetics of this process, we have developed a wounding model in Drosophila melanogaster embryos that allows live imaging of rearrangements and changes in cell shape, and of the cytoskeletal machinery that draws closed an in vivo wound. Using embryos expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, we show that two cytoskeletal-dependent elements -- an actin cable and dynamic filopodial/lamellipodial protrusions -- are expressed by epithelial cells at the wound edge and are pivotal for repair. Modulating the activities of the small GTPases Rho and Cdc42 demonstrates that these actin-dependent elements have differing cellular functions, but that either alone can drive wound closure. The actin cable operates as a 'purse-string' to draw the hole closed, whereas filopodia are essential for the final 'knitting' together of epithelial cells at the end of repair. Our data suggest a more complex model for epithelial repair than previously envisaged and highlight remarkable similarities with the well-characterized morphogenetic movement of dorsal closure in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Sequence comparison of humans and chimpanzees is of interest to understand the mechanisms behind primate evolution. Here we present an independent analysis of human chromosome 21 and the high-quality BAC clone sequences of the homologous chimpanzee chromosome 22. In contrast to previous studies, we have used global alignment methods and Ensembl predictions of protein coding genes (n = 224) for the analysis. Divergence due to insertions and deletions (indels) along with substitutions was examined separately for different genomic features (coding, noncoding genic, and intergenic sequence). The major part of the genomic divergence could be attributed to indels (5.07%), while the nucleotide divergence was estimated as 1.52%. Thus the total divergence was estimated as 6.58%. When excluding repeats and low-complexity DNA the total divergence decreased to 2.37%. The chromosomal distribution of nucleotide substitutions and indel events was significantly correlated. To further examine the role of indels in primate evolution we focused on coding sequences. Indels were found within the coding sequence of 13% of the genes and approximately half of the indels have not been reported previously. In 5% of the chimpanzee genes, indels or substitutions caused premature stop codons that rendered the affected transcripts nonfunctional. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that indels comprise the majority of the genomic divergence. Furthermore, indels occur frequently in coding sequences. Our results thereby support the hypothesis that indels may have a key role in primate evolution.},

Treating both the protein number and gene expression state variables stochastically and on equal footing we propose a mapping which connects the molecular level description of networks to the binary representation. We construct a phase diagram indicating when genes can be considered to be independent and when the coupling between them cannot be neglected leading to synchrony or correlations. We find that an appropriately mapped boolean description reproduces the probabilities of gene expression states of the full stochastic system very well and can be transfered to examples of self-regulatory systems with a larger number of gene copies.},

Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of ~1% along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

abstract = {Grid cells are space-modulated neurons with periodic firing fields. In moving animals, the multiple firing fields of an individual grid cell form a triangular pattern tiling the entire space available to the animal. Collectively, grid cells are thought to provide a context-independent metric representation of the local environment. Since the discovery of grid cells in 2005, a number of models have been proposed to explain the formation of spatially repetitive firing patterns as well as the conversion of these signals to place signals one synapse downstream in the hippocampus. The present article reviews the most recent developments in our understanding of how grid patterns are generated, maintained, and transformed, with particular emphasis on second-generation computational models that have emerged during the past 2-3 years in response to criticism and new data.},

title = {Analysis of conserved noncoding DNA in Drosophila reveals similar constraints in intergenic and intronic sequences},
abstract = {Comparative genomic approaches to gene and cis-regulatory prediction are based on the principle that differential DNA sequence conservation reflects variation in functional constraint. Using this principle, we analyze noncoding sequence conservation in Drosophila for 40 loci with known or suspected cis-regulatory function encompassing >100 kb of DNA. We estimate the fraction of noncoding DNA conserved in both intergenic and intronic regions and describe the length distribution of ungapped conserved noncoding blocks. On average, 22%-26% of noncoding sequences surveyed are conserved in Drosophila, with median block length approximately 19 bp. We show that point substitution in conserved noncoding blocks exhibits transition bias as well as lineage effects in base composition, and occurs more than an order of magnitude more frequently than insertion/deletion (indel) substitution. Overall, patterns of noncoding DNA structure and evolution differ remarkably little between intergenic and intronic conserved blocks, suggesting that the effects of transcription per se contribute minimally to the constraints operating on these sequences. The results of this study have implications for the development of alignment and prediction algorithms specific to noncoding DNA, as well as for models of cis-regulatory DNA sequence evolution.},

title = {Transposable elements and an epigenetic basis for punctuated equilibria},
abstract = {Evolution is frequently concentrated in bursts of rapid morphological change and speciation followed by long-term stasis. We propose that this pattern of punctuated equilibria results from an evolutionary tug-of-war between host genomes and transposable elements (TEs) mediated through the epigenome. According to this hypothesis, epigenetic regulatory mechanisms (RNA interference, DNA methylation and histone modifications) maintain stasis by suppressing TE mobilization. However, physiological stress, induced by climate change or invasion of new habitats, disrupts epigenetic regulation and unleashes TEs. With their capacity to drive non-adaptive host evolution, mobilized TEs can restructure the genome and displace populations from adaptive peaks, thus providing an escape from stasis and generating genetic innovations required for rapid diversification. This "epi-transposon hypothesis" can not only explain macroevolutionary tempo and mode, but may also resolve other long-standing controversies, such as Wright's shifting balance theory, Mayr's peripheral isolates model, and McClintock's view of genome restructuring as an adaptive response to challenge.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) direct gene expression by binding to DNA regulatory regions. To explore the evolution of gene regulation, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine experimentally the genome-wide occupancy of two TFs, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, in the livers of five vertebrates. Although each TF displays highly conserved DNA binding preferences, most binding is species-specific, and aligned binding events present in all five species are rare. Regions near genes with expression levels that are dependent on a TF are often bound by the TF in multiple species yet show no enhanced DNA sequence constraint. Binding divergence between species can be largely explained by sequence changes to the bound motifs. Among the binding events lost in one lineage, only half are recovered by another binding event within 10 kilobases. Our results reveal large interspecies differences in transcriptional regulation and provide insight into regulatory evolution.},

It is not clear whether the redundancy between myf5 and myoD is within the same cell lineage or between distinct lineages. Using lineage tracing and conditional cell ablation in mice, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct lineages in myogenesis: a myf5 lineage and a myf5-independent lineage. Ablating the myf5 lineage is compatible with myogenesis sustained by myf5-independent, myoD-expressing myoblasts, whereas ablation of the myf6 lineage leads to an absence of all differentiated myofibers, although early myogenesis appears to be unaffected. We also demonstrate here the existence of a significant myf5 lineage within ribs that has an important role in rib development, suggested by severe rib defects upon ablating the myf5 lineage.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

In this study, which used value-added models to analyze high-school teachers' effectiveness in raising test scores on 1.05 million end-of-course exams, we found that the effectiveness of high-school science and mathematics teachers increased substantially with experience but exhibited diminishing rates of return by their fourth year; that teachers of algebra 1, algebra 2, biology, and physical science who continued to teach for at least 5 years were more effective as novice teachers than those who left the profession earlier; and that novice teachers of physics, chemistry, physical science, geometry, and biology exhibited steeper growth in effectiveness than did novice non-science, technology, engineering, and mathematics teachers.},

title = {"Genome design" model: evidence from conserved intronic sequence in human-mouse comparison},
abstract = {Introns are shorter in housekeeping genes than in tissue- or development-specific genes. Differing explanations have been offered for this phenomenon: selection for economy (in housekeeping genes), mutation bias or "genomic design." The large-scale implementation in this present paper of a rigorous local sequence alignment algorithm revealed an unprecedented fraction of evolutionarily conserved DNA in human-mouse introns ( approximately 60% of human and approximately 70% of mouse intron length remained after masking for lineage-specific repeats). The length distributions of both conserved and nonconserved regions are very broad but show peaks close to nucleosomal and di-nucleosomal DNA. Both the fraction of conserved sequence and its absolute length were higher in introns of tissue-specific genes than housekeeping genes. This difference remained after control for between-species identity of the conserved fraction, mutation rate, and GC content. In a more direct control, the product of the conserved sequence fraction and the between-species identity of this fraction (which can be considered to be the fraction of conserved nucleotides) was greater in introns of tissue-specific genes than housekeeping genes. Neither the fraction of intron length covered by repeats nor the balance of small insertions and deletions (indels) can explain the greater length of introns in tissue-specific genes. The length of the conserved intronic DNA in a gene is correlated with the number of functional domains in the protein encoded by that gene. These results suggest that the greater length of introns in tissue-specific genes is not due to selection for economy or mutation bias but instead is related to functional complexity (probably mediated by chromatin condensation), and that the evolution of the bulk of noncoding DNA is not completely neutral.},

abstract = {The heart, an ancient organ and the first to form and function during embryogenesis, evolved by the addition of new structures and functions to a primitive pump. Heart development is controlled by an evolutionarily conserved network of transcription factors that connect signaling pathways with genes for muscle growth, patterning, and contractility. During evolution, this ancestral gene network was expanded through gene duplication and co-option of additional networks. Mutations in components of the cardiac gene network cause congenital heart disease, the most common human birth defect. The consequences of such mutations reveal the logic of organogenesis and the evolutionary origins of morphological complexity.},

title = {Ideal glass transitions by random pinning},
abstract = {We study the effect of freezing the positions of a fraction c of particles from an equilibrium configuration of a supercooled liquid at a temperature T. We show that within the random first-order transition theory pinning particles leads to an ideal glass transition for a critical fraction c = c(K)(T) even for moderate supercooling; e.g., close to the Mode-Coupling transition temperature. First we derive the phase diagram in the T - c plane by mean field approximations. Then, by applying a real-space renormalization group method, we obtain the critical properties for |c - c(K)(T)| → 0, in particular the divergence of length and time scales, which are dominated by two zero-temperature fixed points. We also show that for c = c(K)(T) the typical distance between frozen particles is related to the static point-to-set length scale of the unconstrained liquid. We discuss what are the main differences when particles are frozen in other geometries and not from an equilibrium configuration. Finally, we explain why the glass transition induced by freezing particles provides a new and very promising avenue of research to probe the glassy state and ascertain, or disprove, the validity of the theories of the glass transition.},

abstract = {The stable states of differentiated cells are now known to be controlled by dynamic mechanisms that can easily be perturbed. An adult cell can therefore be reprogrammed, altering its pattern of gene expression, and hence its fate, to that typical of another cell type. This has been shown by three distinct experimental approaches to nuclear reprogramming: nuclear transfer, cell fusion and transcription-factor transduction. Using these approaches, nuclei from 'terminally differentiated' somatic cells can be induced to express genes that are typical of embryonic stem cells, which can differentiate to form all of the cell types in the body. This remarkable discovery of cellular plasticity has important medical applications.},

abstract = {The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

title = {Six1 expands the mouse mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cell pool and induces mammary tumors that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition},
abstract = {Six1 is a developmentally regulated homeoprotein with limited expression in most normal adult tissues and frequent misexpression in a variety of malignancies. Here we demonstrate, using a bitransgenic mouse model, that misexpression of human Six1 in adult mouse mammary gland epithelium induces tumors of multiple histological subtypes in a dose-dependent manner. The neoplastic lesions induced by Six1 had an in situ origin, showed diverse differentiation, and exhibited progression to aggressive malignant neoplasms, as is often observed in human carcinoma of the breast. Strikingly, the vast majority of Six1-induced tumors underwent an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and expressed multiple targets of activated Wnt signaling, including cyclin D1. Interestingly, Six1 and cyclin D1 coexpression was found to frequently occur in human breast cancers and was strongly predictive of poor prognosis. We further show that Six1 promoted a stem/progenitor cell phenotype in the mouse mammary gland and in Six1-driven mammary tumors. Our data thus provide genetic evidence for a potent oncogenic role for Six1 in mammary epithelial neoplasia, including promotion of EMT and stem cell-like features.},

abstract = {The development of myogenic cells is mainly determined by expression of two myogenic factors, Myf5 and Myod1 (MyoD), which genetically compensate for each other during embryogenesis. Here, we demonstrate by conditional cell ablation in mice that Myf5 determines a distinct myogenic cell population, which also contains some Myod1-positive cells. Ablation of this lineage uncovers the presence of a second autonomous myogenic lineage, which superseded Myf5-dependent myogenic cells and expressed Myod1. By contrast, ablation of myogenin-expressing cells erased virtually all differentiated muscle cells, indicating that some aspects of the myogenic program are shared by most skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that Myf5 and Myod1 define different cell lineages with distinct contributions to muscle precursor cells and differentiated myotubes. Individual myogenic cell lineages seem to substitute for each other within the developing embryo.},

title = {EBF2 Determines and Maintains Brown Adipocyte Identity},
abstract = {The master transcription factor Pparγ regulates the general differentiation program of both brown and white adipocytes. However, it has been unclear whether Pparγ also controls fat lineage-specific characteristics. Here, we show that early B cell factor-2 (Ebf2) regulates Pparγ binding activity to determine brown versus white adipocyte identity. The Ebf DNA-binding motif was highly enriched within brown adipose-specific Pparγ binding sites that we identified by genome-wide ChIP-Seq. Of the Ebf isoforms, Ebf2 was selectively expressed in brown relative to white adipocytes and was bound at brown adipose-specific Pparγ target genes. When expressed in myoblasts or white preadipose cells, Ebf2 recruited Pparγ to its brown-selective binding sites and reprogrammed cells to a brown fat fate. Brown adipose cells and tissue from Ebf2-deficient mice displayed a loss of brown-specific characteristics and thermogenic capacity. Together, these results identify Ebf2 as a key transcriptional regulator of brown fat cell fate and function.},

title = {Algorithm of myogenic differentiation in higher-order organisms},
abstract = {Cell fate determination is governed by complex signaling molecules at appropriate concentrations that regulate the cell decision-making process. In vertebrates, however, concentration and kinetic parameters are practically unknown, and therefore the mechanism by which these molecules interact is obscure. In myogenesis, for example, multipotent cells differentiate into skeletal muscle as a result of appropriate interplay between several signaling molecules, which is not sufficiently characterized. Here we demonstrate that treatment of biochemical events with SAT (satisfiability) formalism, which has been primarily applied for solving decision-making problems, can provide a simple conceptual tool for describing the relationship between causes and effects in biological phenomena. Specifically, we applied the Łukasiewicz logic to a diffusible protein system that leads to myogenesis. The creation of an automaton that describes the myogenesis SAT problem has led to a comprehensive overview of this non-trivial phenomenon and also to a hypothesis that was subsequently verified experimentally. This example demonstrates the power of applying Łukasiewicz logic in describing and predicting any decision-making problem in general, and developmental processes in particular.},

abstract = {The expression of genes is regularly characterized with respect to how much, how fast, when and where. Such quantitative data demands quantitative models. Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the "regulation factor". This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell.},

title = {Transcription factor Ebf1 regulates differentiation stage-specific signaling, proliferation, and survival of B cells},
abstract = {The transcription factor Ebf1 is an important determinant of early B lymphopoiesis. To gain insight into the functions of Ebf1 at distinct stages of differentiation, we conditionally inactivated Ebf1. We found that Ebf1 is required for the proliferation, survival, and signaling of pro-B cells and peripheral B-cell subsets, including B1 cells and marginal zone B cells. The proliferation defect of Ebf1-deficient pro-B cells and the impaired expression of multiple cell cycle regulators are overcome by transformation with v-Abl. The survival defect of transformed Ebf1(fl/fl) pro-B cells can be rescued by the forced expression of the Ebf1 targets c-Myb or Bcl-x(L). In mature B cells, Ebf1 deficiency interferes with signaling via the B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R)- and B-cell receptor (BCR)-dependent Akt pathways. Moreover, Ebf1 is required for germinal center formation and class switch recombination. Genome-wide analyses of Ebf1-mediated gene expression and chromatin binding indicate that Ebf1 regulates both common and distinct sets of genes in early and late stage B cells. By regulating important components of transcription factor and signaling networks, Ebf1 appears to be involved in the coordination of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation at multiple stages of B lymphopoiesis.},

abstract = {Embryonic development is controlled by networks of interacting regulatory genes. The individual linkages of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are customarily validated by functional cis-regulatory analysis, but an additional approach to validation is to rewire GRN circuitry to test experimentally predictions derived from network structure. Here we use this synthetic method to challenge specific predictions of the sea urchin embryo endomesoderm GRN. Expression vectors generated by in vitro recombination of exogenous sequences into BACs were used to cause elements of a nonskeletogenic mesoderm GRN to be deployed in skeletogenic cells and to detect their effects. The result of reengineering the regulatory circuitry in this way was to divert the developmental program of these cells from skeletogenesis to pigment cell formation, confirming a direct prediction of the GRN. In addition, the experiment revealed previously undetected cryptic repression functions.},

abstract = {Understanding inductive reasoning is a problem that has engaged mankind for thousands of years. This problem is relevant to a wide range of fields and is integral to the philosophy of science. It has been tackled by many great minds ranging from philosophers to scientists to mathematicians, and more recently computer scientists. In this article we argue the case for Solomonoff Induction, a formal inductive framework which combines algorithmic information theory with the Bayesian framework. Although it achieves excellent theoretical results and is based on solid philosophical foundations, the requisite technical knowledge necessary for understanding this framework has caused it to remain largely unknown and unappreciated in the wider scientific community. The main contribution of this article is to convey Solomonoff induction and its related concepts in a generally accessible form with the aim of bridging this current technical gap. In the process we examine the major historical contributions that have led to the formulation of Solomonoff Induction as well as criticisms of Solomonoff and induction in general. In particular we examine how Solomonoff induction addresses many issues that have plagued other inductive systems, such as the black ravens paradox and the confirmation problem, and compare this approach with other recent approaches.},

By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.},

abstract = {Tissue-specific transcriptional activators initiate differentiation towards specialized cell types by inducing chromatin modifications permissive for transcription at target loci, through the recruitment of SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodelling complex. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates SWI/SNF nuclear distribution in response to differentiation signals is unknown. We show that the muscle determination factor MyoD and the SWI/SNF subunit BAF60c interact on the regulatory elements of MyoD-target genes in myoblasts, prior to activation of transcription. BAF60c facilitates MyoD binding to target genes and marks the chromatin for signal-dependent recruitment of the SWI/SNF core to muscle genes. BAF60c phosphorylation on a conserved threonine by differentiation-activated p38α kinase is the signal that promotes incorporation of MyoD-BAF60c into a Brg1-based SWI/SNF complex, which remodels the chromatin and activates transcription of MyoD-target genes. Our data support an unprecedented two-step model by which pre-assembled BAF60c-MyoD complex directs recruitment of SWI/SNF to muscle loci in response to differentiation cues.},

title = {DNA transposons: nature and applications in genomics},
abstract = {Repeated DNA makes up a large fraction of a typical mammalian genome, and some repetitive elements are able to move within the genome (transposons and retrotransposons). DNA transposons move from one genomic location to another by a cut-and-paste mechanism. They are powerful forces of genetic change and have played a significant role in the evolution of many genomes. As genetic tools, DNA transposons can be used to introduce a piece of foreign DNA into a genome. Indeed, they have been used for transgenesis and insertional mutagenesis in different organisms, since these elements are not generally dependent on host factors to mediate their mobility. Thus, DNA transposons are useful tools to analyze the regulatory genome, study embryonic development, identify genes and pathways implicated in disease or pathogenesis of pathogens, and even contribute to gene therapy. In this review, we will describe the nature of these elements and discuss recent advances in this field of research, as well as our evolving knowledge of the DNA transposons most widely used in these studies.},

We first review some fundamental concepts in the physics of phase transitions. We then derive criteria governing under what conditions spatial disorder or randomness can change the properties of a phase transition. After introducing the strong-disorder renormalization group method, we discuss in detail some of the exotic phenomena arising at phase transitions in disordered quantum systems. These include infinite-randomness criticality, rare regions and quantum Griffiths singularities, as well as the smearing of phase transitions. We also present a number of experimental examples.},

title = {Noise propagation in gene networks},
abstract = {Accurately predicting noise propagation in gene networks is crucial for understanding signal fidelity in natural networks and designing noise-tolerant gene circuits. To quantify how noise propagates through gene networks, we measured expression correlations between genes in single cells. We found that noise in a gene was determined by its intrinsic fluctuations, transmitted noise from upstream genes, and global noise affecting all genes. A model was developed that explains the complex behavior exhibited by the correlations and reveals the dominant noise sources. The model successfully predicts the correlations as the network is systematically perturbed. This approach provides a step toward understanding and manipulating noise propagation in more complex gene networks.},

abstract = {Mobile elements such as Alu repeats have substantially altered the architecture of the human genome, and de novo mobile element insertions sometimes cause genetic disorders. Previous estimates for the retrotransposition rate (RR) of Alu elements in humans of one new insertion every approximately 100-125 births were developed prior to the sequencing of the human and chimpanzee genomes. Here, we used two independent methods (based on the new genomic data and on disease-causing de novo Alu insertions) to generate refined Alu RR estimates in humans. Both methods consistently yielded RR on the order of one new Alu insertion every approximately 20 births, despite the fact that the evolutionary-based method represents an average RR over the past approximately 6 million years while the mutation-based method better reflects the current-day RR. These results suggest that Alu elements retrotranspose at a faster rate in humans than previously thought, and support the potential of Alu elements as mutagenic factors in the human genome.},

abstract = {Flocking is a typical example of emergent collective behavior, where interactions between individuals produce collective patterns on the large scale. Here we show how a quantitative microscopic theory for directional ordering in a flock can be derived directly from field data. We construct the minimally structured (maximum entropy) model consistent with experimental correlations in large flocks of starlings. The maximum entropy model shows that local, pairwise interactions between birds are sufficient to correctly predict the propagation of order throughout entire flocks of starlings, with no free parameters. We also find that the number of interacting neighbors is independent of flock density, confirming that interactions are ruled by topological rather than metric distance. Finally, by comparing flocks of different sizes, the model correctly accounts for the observed scale invariance of long-range correlations among the fluctuations in flight direction.},

We show how simple arguments lead to theories of the rate of such events much like the absolute rate theory of chemical reactions corrected by a transmission factor. Both the probability of the rare cellular states that allow epigenetic escape and the transmission factor depend on the rates of DNA binding and unbinding events and on the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Different mechanisms of escape from the stable attractors occur in the nonadiabatic, weakly adiabatic, and strictly adiabatic regimes, characterized by the relative values of those input rates.},

abstract = {Most algorithms for the alignment of biological sequences are not derived from an evolutionary model. Consequently, these alignment algorithms lack a strong statistical basis. A maximum likelihood method for the alignment of two DNA sequences is presented. This method is based upon a statistical model of DNA sequence evolution for which we have obtained explicit transition probabilities. The evolutionary model can also be used as the basis of procedures that estimate the evolutionary parameters relevant to a pair of unaligned DNA sequences. A parameter-estimation approach which takes into account all possible alignments between two sequences is introduced; the danger of estimating evolutionary parameters from a single alignment is discussed.},

abstract = {It is now well accepted that both Dark Matter and Dark Energy are required in any successful cosmological model. Although there is ample evidence that both Dark components are necessary, the conventional theories make no prediction for the contributions from each of them. Moreover, there is usually no intrinsic relationship between the two components, and no understanding of the nature of the mysteries of the Dark Sector. Here we suggest that if the Dark Side is so seductive then we should not be restricted to just 2 components. We further suggest that the most natural model has 5 distinct forms of Dark Energy in addition to the usual Dark Matter, each contributing precisely equally to the cosmic energy density budget.},

abstract = {Satellite cells play a central role in mediating the growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle. However, whether satellite cells are stem cells, committed progenitors, or dedifferentiated myoblasts has remained unclear. Using Myf5-Cre and ROSA26-YFP Cre-reporter alleles, we observed that in vivo 10% of sublaminar Pax7-expressing satellite cells have never expressed Myf5. Moreover, we found that Pax7(+)/Myf5(-) satellite cells gave rise to Pax7(+)/Myf5(+) satellite cells through apical-basal oriented divisions that asymmetrically generated a basal Pax7(+)/Myf5(-) and an apical Pax7(+)/Myf5(+) cells. Prospective isolation and transplantation into muscle revealed that whereas Pax7(+)/Myf5(+) cells exhibited precocious differentiation, Pax7(+)/Myf5(-) cells extensively contributed to the satellite cell reservoir throughout the injected muscle. Therefore, we conclude that satellite cells are a heterogeneous population composed of stem cells and committed progenitors. These results provide critical insights into satellite cell biology and open new avenues for therapeutic treatment of neuromuscular diseases.},

title = {Identification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project SI},
abstract = {We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

title = {Power-law distributions in empirical data},
abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution - the part of the distribution representing large but rare events - and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

title = {cis-Regulatory networks during development: a view of Drosophila},
abstract = {Understanding how regulatory networks initiate, maintain and synchronise transcriptional states remains a fundamental goal of developmental biology. Complex patterns of spatio-temporal gene expression are generated through the combined inputs of signalling and transcriptional networks converging on cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). Detailed studies in Drosophila, using transgenic reporter assays and mutagenesis analysis, have dissected the regulatory logic of a number of CRMs. These data have recently been complemented by genome-wide maps of transcription factor binding, revealing an unprecedented view of CRM occupancy and network complexity. The synthesis of data for three well-characterised Drosophila developmental networks reveals emerging themes at both a CRM and a cis-regulatory network level.},

title = {Protein-DNA binding specificity predictions with structural models},
abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions play a central role in transcriptional regulation and other biological processes. Investigating the mechanism of binding affinity and specificity in protein-DNA complexes is thus an important goal. Here we develop a simple physical energy function, which uses electrostatics, solvation, hydrogen bonds and atom-packing terms to model direct readout and sequence-specific DNA conformational energy to model indirect readout of DNA sequence by the bound protein. The predictive capability of the model is tested against another model based only on the knowledge of the consensus sequence and the number of contacts between amino acids and DNA bases. Both models are used to carry out predictions of protein-DNA binding affinities which are then compared with experimental measurements. The nearly additive nature of protein-DNA interaction energies in our model allows us to construct position-specific weight matrices by computing base pair probabilities independently for each position in the binding site. Our approach is less data intensive than knowledge-based models of protein-DNA interactions, and is not limited to any specific family of transcription factors. However, native structures of protein-DNA complexes or their close homologs are required as input to the model. Use of homology modeling can significantly increase the extent of our approach, making it a useful tool for studying regulatory pathways in many organisms and cell types.},

title = {Cyclin E-cdk2 phosphorylation promotes late G1-phase degradation of MyoD in muscle cells},
abstract = {Proliferating myoblasts already express MyoD before the induction of differentiation. Overexpression of MyoD in normal and transformed cell lines was shown to block cells from entering S phase, suggesting that the MyoD growth suppressive effect must be tightly controlled in growing myoblasts. Here we show that during G1 phase, but not in G2, MyoD abundance is down-regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through phosphorylation of serine 200. Roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of cyclin-Cdk2 complexes, prevents both phosphorylation and degradation of MyoD in G1. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway by MG132 results in stabilization of MyoD-wt, with little effect on a MyoD mutant where serine 200 is replaced by an alanine. Our results show that MyoD Ser200 is the substrate for phosphorylation by cyclin E-Cdk2 stimulating its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system which controls MyoD levels in G1. Phosphorylation/degradation of MyoD at the end of G1 thus represents the regulatory checkpoint in growing myoblasts allowing progression into S phase in a manner similar to the recently examplified cdk2-phosphorylation/degradation of p27(Kip1).},

title = {An end to endless forms: epistasis, phenotype distribution bias, and nonuniform evolution},
abstract = {Studies of the evolution of development characterize the way in which gene regulatory dynamics during ontogeny constructs and channels phenotypic variation. These studies have identified a number of evolutionary regularities: (1) phenotypes occupy only a small subspace of possible phenotypes, (2) the influence of mutation is not uniform and is often canalized, and (3) a great deal of morphological variation evolved early in the history of multicellular life. An important implication of these studies is that diversity is largely the outcome of the evolution of gene regulation rather than the emergence of new, structural genes. Using a simple model that considers a generic property of developmental maps-the interaction between multiple genetic elements and the nonlinearity of gene interaction in shaping phenotypic traits-we are able to recover many of these empirical regularities. We show that visible phenotypes represent only a small fraction of possibilities. Epistasis ensures that phenotypes are highly clustered in morphospace and that the most frequent phenotypes are the most similar. We perform phylogenetic analyses on an evolving, developmental model and find that species become more alike through time, whereas higher-level grades have a tendency to diverge. Ancestral phenotypes, produced by early developmental programs with a low level of gene interaction, are found to span a significantly greater volume of the total phenotypic space than derived taxa. We suggest that early and late evolution have a different character that we classify into micro- and macroevolutionary configurations. These findings complement the view of development as a key component in the production of endless forms and highlight the crucial role of development in constraining biotic diversity and evolutionary trajectories.},

title = {Evolution of regulatory sequences in 12 Drosophila species},
abstract = {Characterization of the evolutionary constraints acting on cis-regulatory sequences is crucial to comparative genomics and provides key insights on the evolution of organismal diversity. We study the relationships among orthologous cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in 12 Drosophila species, especially with respect to the evolution of transcription factor binding sites, and report statistical evidence in favor of key evolutionary hypotheses. Binding sites are found to have position-specific substitution rates. However, the selective forces at different positions of a site do not act independently, and the evidence suggests that constraints on sites are often based on their exact binding affinities. Binding site loss is seen to conform to a molecular clock hypothesis. The rate of site loss is transcription factor-specific and depends on the strength of binding and, in some cases, the presence of other binding sites in close proximity. Our analysis is based on a novel computational method for aligning orthologous CRMs on a tree, which rigorously accounts for alignment uncertainties and exploits binding site predictions through a unified probabilistic framework. Finally, we report weak purifying selection on short deletions, providing important clues about overall spatial constraints on CRMs. Our results present a complex picture of regulatory sequence evolution, with substantial plasticity that depends on a number of factors. The insights gained in this study will help us to understand the combinatorial control of gene regulation and how it evolves. They will pave the way for theoretical models that are cognizant of the important determinants of regulatory sequence evolution and will be critical in genome-wide identification of non-coding sequences under purifying or positive selection.},

title = {Darwinian evolution can follow only very few mutational paths to fitter proteins},
abstract = {Five point mutations in a particular beta-lactamase allele jointly increase bacterial resistance to a clinically important antibiotic by a factor of approximately 100,000. In principle, evolution to this high-resistance beta-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the beta-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.},

abstract = {Cis-regulatory control of transcription is the dominant form of regulation of gene expression. Recent experimental results suggest that, in addition to the mean expression level, cell-to-cell variability might also be transcriptionally regulated. Here, we develop a stochastic model of transcriptional regulation that allows us to calculate closed-form analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the protein and mRNA distributions for an arbitrarily complex cis-regulatory motif. Our model allows us to investigate how noise may be transcriptionally regulated independently from the mean expression. We show that our approach is in excellent agreement with stochastic simulations and experiment, and leads to an experimentally testable formula for the noise in gene expression as a function of inducer-molecule concentrations.},

The primary function of satellite cells is to mediate postnatal muscle growth and repair. Owing to their availability and remarkable capacity to regenerate damaged muscle, satellite cells and their descendent myoblasts have been considered as powerful candidates for cell-based therapies to treat muscular dystrophies and other neuromuscular diseases. However, regenerative medicine in muscle repair requires a thorough understanding of, and the ability to manipulate, the molecular mechanisms that control the proliferation, self-renewal and myogenic differentiation of satellite cells. Here, we review the latest advances in our current understanding of the quiescence, activation, proliferation and self-renewal of satellite cells and the challenges in the development of satellite cell-based regenerative medicine.},

title = {Imbalance between pSmad3 and Notch induces CDK inhibitors in old muscle stem cells},
abstract = {Adult skeletal muscle robustly regenerates throughout an organism's life, but as the muscle ages, its ability to repair diminishes and eventually fails. Previous work suggests that the regenerative potential of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) is not triggered in the old muscle because of a decline in Notch activation, and that it can be rejuvenated by forced local activation of Notch. Here we report that, in addition to the loss of Notch activation, old muscle produces excessive transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (but not myostatin), which induces unusually high levels of TGF-beta pSmad3 in resident satellite cells and interferes with their regenerative capacity. Importantly, endogenous Notch and pSmad3 antagonize each other in the control of satellite-cell proliferation, such that activation of Notch blocks the TGF-beta-dependent upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16, p21 and p27, whereas inhibition of Notch induces them. Furthermore, in muscle stem cells, Notch activity determines the binding of pSmad3 to the promoters of these negative regulators of cell-cycle progression. Attenuation of TGF-beta/pSmad3 in old, injured muscle restores regeneration to satellite cells in vivo. Thus a balance between endogenous pSmad3 and active Notch controls the regenerative competence of muscle stem cells, and deregulation of this balance in the old muscle microniche interferes with regeneration.},

title = {Evolution of genes and genomes on the Drosophila phylogeny},
abstract = {Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the precision and sensitivity of evolutionary inference, producing more robust results than single-genome analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.},

Gene activation may involve DNA loop formation between enhancer-bound transcription factors and the transcription apparatus at the core promoter, but this process is not well understood. Here we report that mediator and cohesin physically and functionally connect the enhancers and core promoters of active genes in murine embryonic stem cells. Mediator, a transcriptional coactivator, forms a complex with cohesin, which can form rings that connect two DNA segments. The cohesin-loading factor Nipbl is associated with mediator-cohesin complexes, providing a means to load cohesin at promoters. DNA looping is observed between the enhancers and promoters occupied by mediator and cohesin. Mediator and cohesin co-occupy different promoters in different cells, thus generating cell-type-specific DNA loops linked to the gene expression program of each cell.},

title = {The Significance of Information in Quantum Theory},
abstract = {We propose a system of information-theoretic axioms from which we derive the formalism of quantum theory. Part I is devoted to the conceptual foundations of the information-theoretic approach. We argue that this approach belongs to the epistemological framework depicted as a loop of existences. In Part II we derive the quantum formalism from information-theoretic axioms and we analyze the twofold role of observer as physical system and as informational agent. Quantum logical techniques are then introduced, and we prove theorems reconstructing elements of the formalism. In Part III, we introduce the formalism of C*-algebras and give it an information theoretic interpretation. We analyze the conceptual underpinnings of the theory of modular automorphisms and we give an information-theoretic justification for the emergence of time in the algebraic approach. We conclude by giving a list of open questions, including topics in cognitive science, decision theory, and information technology.},

title = {Different cell fates from cell-cell interactions: core architectures of two-cell bistable networks (SI)},
abstract = {The acquisition of different fates by cells that are initially in the same state is central to development. Here, we investigate the possible structures of bistable genetic networks that can allow two identical cells to acquire different fates through cell-cell interactions. Cell-autonomous bistable networks have been previously sampled using an evolutionary algorithm. We extend this evolutionary procedure to take into account interactions between cells. We obtain a variety of simple bistable networks that we classify into major subtypes. Some have long been proposed in the context of lateral inhibition through the Notch-Delta pathway, some have been more recently considered and others appear to be new and based on mechanisms not previously considered. The results highlight the role of posttranscriptional interactions and particularly of protein complexation and sequestration, which can replace cooperativity in transcriptional interactions. Some bistable networks are entirely based on posttranscriptional interactions and the simplest of these is found to lead, upon a single parameter change, to oscillations in the two cells with opposite phases. We provide qualitative explanations as well as mathematical analyses of the dynamical behaviors of various created networks. The results should help to identify and understand genetic structures implicated in cell-cell interactions and differentiation.},

abstract = {The expression of three microRNAs, miR-1, miR-206 and miR-133 is restricted to skeletal myoblasts and cardiac tissue during embryo development and muscle cell differentiation, which suggests a regulation by muscle regulatory factors (MRFs). Here we show that inhibition of C2C12 muscle cell differentiation by FGFs, which interferes with the activity of MRFs, suppressed the expression of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-133. To further investigate the role of myogenic regulators (MRFs), Myf5, MyoD, Myogenin and MRF4 in the regulation of muscle specific microRNAs we performed gain and loss-of-function experiments in vivo, in chicken and mouse embryos. We found that directed expression of MRFs in the neural tube of chicken embryos induced ectopic expression of miR-1 and miR-206. Conversely, the lack of Myf5 but not of MyoD resulted in a loss of miR-1 and miR-206 expression. Taken together our results demonstrate differential requirements of distinct MRFs for the induction of microRNA gene expression during skeletal myogenesis.},

This article illustrates the power of this resource for exploring vertebrate and mammalian evolution, using three examples. First, we present several vignettes involving insertions and deletions within protein-coding regions, including a look at some human-specific indels. Then we study the extent to which start codons and stop codons in the human sequence are conserved in other species, showing that start codons are in general more poorly conserved than stop codons. Finally, an investigation of the phylogenetic depth of conservation for several classes of functional elements in the human genome reveals striking differences in the rates and modes of decay in alignability. Each functional class has a distinctive period of stringent constraint, followed by decays that allow (for the case of regulatory regions) or reject (for coding regions and ultraconserved elements) insertions and deletions.},

title = {Identification of MEF2-regulated genes during muscle differentiation},
abstract = {Although a great deal has been elucidated concerning the mechanisms regulating muscle differentiation, little is known about transcription factor-specific gene regulation. Our understanding of the genetic mechanisms regulating cell differentiation is quite limited. Much of what has been defined centers on regulatory signaling cascades and transcription factors. Surprisingly few studies have investigated the association of genes with specific transcription factors. To address these issues, we have utilized a method coupling chromatin immunoprecipitation and CpG microarrays to characterize the genes associated with MEF2 in differentiating C(2)C(12) cells. Results demonstrated a defined binding pattern over the course of differentiation. Filtered data demonstrated 9 clones to be elevated at 0 h, 792 at 6 h, 163 by 1 day, and 316 at 3 days. Using unbiased selection parameters, we selected a subset of 291 prospective candidates. Clones were sequenced and filtered for removal of redundancy between clones and for the presence of repetitive elements. We were able to place 50 of these on the mouse genome, and 20 were found to be located near well-annotated genes. From this list, previously undefined associations with MEF2 were discovered. Many of these genes represent proteins involved in neurogenesis, neuromuscular junctions, signaling and metabolism. The remaining clones include many full-length cDNA and represent novel gene targets. The results of this study provides for the first time, a unique look at gene regulation at the level of transcription factor binding in differentiating muscle.},

title = {Intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to stochasticity in gene expression},
abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

title = {Genome regulation by long noncoding RNAs},
abstract = {The central dogma of gene expression is that DNA is transcribed into messenger RNAs, which in turn serve as the template for protein synthesis. The discovery of extensive transcription of large RNA transcripts that do not code for proteins, termed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), provides an important new perspective on the centrality of RNA in gene regulation. Here, we discuss genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with numerous chromatin regulators and then target these enzymatic activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent with this notion, lncRNAs can function as modular scaffolds to specify higher-order organization in RNP complexes and in chromatin states. The importance of these modes of regulation is underscored by the newly recognized roles of long RNAs for proper gene control across all kingdoms of life.},

abstract = {The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the human brain was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure patterns of response in ventral temporal cortex while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories of man-made objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of response was found for each stimulus category. The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate that the representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex are widely distributed and overlapping.},

abstract = {The pathogenicity of many bacteria depends on the injection of effector proteins via type III secretion into eukaryotic cells in order to manipulate cellular processes. TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors from plant pathogenic Xanthomonas are important virulence factors that act as transcriptional activators in the plant cell nucleus, where they directly bind to DNA via a central domain of tandem repeats. Here, we show how target DNA specificity of TAL effectors is encoded. Two hypervariable amino acid residues in each repeat recognize one base pair in the target DNA. Recognition sequences of TAL effectors were predicted and experimentally confirmed. The modular protein architecture enabled the construction of artificial effectors with new specificities. Our study describes the functionality of a distinct type of DNA binding domain and allows the design of DNA binding domains for biotechnology.},

title = {Expression of myogenin during embryogenesis is controlled by Six/sine oculis homeoproteins through a conserved MEF3 binding site},
abstract = {Myogenin, one of the MyoD family of proteins, is expressed early during somitogenesis and is required for myoblast fusion in vivo. Previous studies in transgenic mice have shown that a 184-bp myogenin promoter fragment is sufficient to correctly drive expression of a beta-galactosidase transgene during embryogenesis. We show here that mutation of one of the DNA motifs present in this region, the MEF3 motif, abolished correct expression of this beta-galactosidase transgene. We have found that the proteins that bind to the MEF3 site are homeoproteins of the Six/sine oculis family. Antibodies directed specifically against Six1 or Six4 proteins reveal that each of these proteins is present in the embryo when myogenin is activated and constitutes a muscle-specific MEF3-binding activity in adult muscle nuclear extracts. Both of these proteins accumulate in the nucleus of C2C12 myogenic cells, and transient transfection experiments confirm that Six1 and Six4 are able to transactivate a reporter gene containing MEF3 sites. Altogether these results establish Six homeoproteins as a family of transcription factors controlling muscle formation through activation of one of its key regulators, myogenin.},

Vertebrate skeletal muscle has a remarkable ability to regenerate after repeated and complete destruction of the tissue, yet limited information is available on how muscle stem and progenitor cells, and other nonmuscle cells, reestablish homeostasis after the regenerative process. The genetic pathways that regulate the establishment of skeletal muscle in the embryo have been studied extensively, and many of the genes that govern muscle stem cell maintenance and commitment are redeployed during adult homeostasis and regeneration. Therefore, correlates can be made between embryonic muscle development and postnatal regeneration. However, there are some important distinctions between prenatal development and regeneration - in the context of the cells, niche, anatomy and the regulatory genes employed. The similarities and distinctions between these two scenarios are the focus of this review.},

These approaches include phylogenetic predictions for the phosphorylation, sumoylation and ubiquitylation of pathway components, as well as kinetic models of endocytosis, phosphorylation and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. We review these studies and provide a brief ;how to' guide for phylogenetics. Our hope is to stimulate experimental tests of informatics-based predictions for TGFbeta signaling, as well as for other signaling pathways, and to expand the number of developmental pathways that are being analyzed computationally.},

abstract = {We recently witnessed a tremendous increase in genomics studies on gene regulation and in entirely sequenced genomes from closely related species. This has triggered analyses that suggest a wide range of evolutionary dynamics of gene regulation, from rapid turnover of transcription-factor binding sites to conservation of enhancer function across large evolutionary distances. Many examples show that enhancers can evolve beyond recognizable sequence similarity while retaining function. However, bioinformatics approaches are increasingly able to detect conserved regulatory elements through characteristic evolutionary sequence signatures. Cis-regulatory changes are also a major source of morphological evolution, which might be facilitated by many biochemically functional elements that are selectively neutral and by the buffering function of redundant enhancers and 'shadow' enhancers.},

title = {The Msx1 Homeoprotein Recruits Polycomb to the Nuclear Periphery during Development (SI)},
abstract = {Control of gene expression during development requires the concerted action of sequence-specific transcriptional regulators and epigenetic modifiers, which are spatially coordinated within the nucleus through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we show that transcriptional repression by the Msx1 homeoprotein in myoblast cells requires the recruitment of Polycomb to target genes located at the nuclear periphery. Target genes repressed by Msx1 display an Msx1-dependent enrichment of Polycomb-directed trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). Association of Msx1 with the Polycomb complex is required for repression and regulation of myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, Msx1 promotes a dynamic spatial redistribution of the H3K27me3 repressive mark to the nuclear periphery in myoblast cells and the developing limb in vivo. Our findings illustrate a hitherto unappreciated spatial coordination of transcription factors with the Polycomb complex for appropriate regulation of gene expression programs during development.},

title = {Adaptive evolution and the birth of CTCF binding sites in the Drosophila genome},
abstract = {Changes in the physical interaction between cis-regulatory DNA sequences and proteins drive the evolution of gene expression. However, it has proven difficult to accurately quantify evolutionary rates of such binding change or to estimate the relative effects of selection and drift in shaping the binding evolution. Here we examine the genome-wide binding of CTCF in four species of Drosophila separated by between ∼2.5 and 25 million years. CTCF is a highly conserved protein known to be associated with insulator sequences in the genomes of human and Drosophila. Although the binding preference for CTCF is highly conserved, we find that CTCF binding itself is highly evolutionarily dynamic and has adaptively evolved. Between species, binding divergence increased linearly with evolutionary distance, and CTCF binding profiles are diverging rapidly at the rate of 2.22% per million years (Myr). At least 89 new CTCF binding sites have originated in the Drosophila melanogaster genome since the most recent common ancestor with Drosophila simulans. Comparing these data to genome sequence data from 37 different strains of Drosophila melanogaster, we detected signatures of selection in both newly gained and evolutionarily conserved binding sites. Newly evolved CTCF binding sites show a significantly stronger signature for positive selection than older sites. Comparative gene expression profiling revealed that expression divergence of genes adjacent to CTCF binding site is significantly associated with the gain and loss of CTCF binding. Further, the birth of new genes is associated with the birth of new CTCF binding sites. Our data indicate that binding of Drosophila CTCF protein has evolved under natural selection, and CTCF binding evolution has shaped both the evolution of gene expression and genome evolution during the birth of new genes.},

abstract = {A fraction of a genetically homogeneous microbial population may survive exposure to stress such as antibiotic treatment. Unlike resistant mutants, cells regrown from such persistent bacteria remain sensitive to the antibiotic. We investigated the persistence of single cells of Escherichia coli with the use of microfluidic devices. Persistence was linked to preexisting heterogeneity in bacterial populations because phenotypic switching occurred between normally growing cells and persister cells having reduced growth rates. Quantitative measurements led to a simple mathematical description of the persistence switch. Inherent heterogeneity of bacterial populations may be important in adaptation to fluctuating environments and in the persistence of bacterial infections.},

abstract = {Evolution is a quest for innovation. Organisms adapt to changing natural selection by evolving new phenotypes. Can we read this dynamics in their genomes? Not every mutation under positive selection responds to a change in selection: beneficial changes also occur at evolutionary equilibrium, repairing previous deleterious changes and restoring existing functions. Adaptation, by contrast, is viewed here as a non-equilibrium phenomenon: the genomic response to time-dependent selection. Our approach extends the static concept of fitness landscapes to dynamic fitness seascapes. It shows that adaptation requires a surplus of beneficial substitutions over deleterious ones. Here, we focus on the evolution of yeast and Drosophila genomes, providing examples where adaptive evolution can and cannot be inferred, despite the presence of positive selection.},

title = {Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities},
abstract = {Genome-scale studies have revealed extensive, cell type-specific colocalization of transcription factors, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

title = {Sequence features and chromatin structure around the genomic regions bound by 119 human transcription factors},
abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become the dominant technique for mapping transcription factor (TF) binding regions genome-wide. We performed an integrative analysis centered around 457 ChIP-seq data sets on 119 human TFs generated by the ENCODE Consortium. We identified highly enriched sequence motifs in most data sets, revealing new motifs and validating known ones. The motif sites (TF binding sites) are highly conserved evolutionarily and show distinct footprints upon DNase I digestion. We frequently detected secondary motifs in addition to the canonical motifs of the TFs, indicating tethered binding and cobinding between multiple TFs. We observed significant position and orientation preferences between many cobinding TFs. Genes specifically expressed in a cell line are often associated with a greater occurrence of nearby TF binding in that cell line. We observed cell-line-specific secondary motifs that mediate the binding of the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and the enhancer-binding protein EP300. TF binding sites are located in GC-rich, nucleosome-depleted, and DNase I sensitive regions, flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes, and many of these features show cell type specificity. The GC-richness may be beneficial for regulating TF binding because, when unoccupied by a TF, these regions are occupied by nucleosomes in vivo. We present the results of our analysis in a TF-centric web repository Factorbook (http://factorbook.org) and will continually update this repository as more ENCODE data are generated.},

title = {Gene connectivity, function, and sequence conservation: predictions from modular yeast co-expression networks},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genes and proteins are organized into functional modular networks in which the network context of a gene or protein has implications for cellular function. Highly connected hub proteins, largely responsible for maintaining network connectivity, have been found to be much more likely to be essential for yeast survival. RESULTS: Here we investigate the properties of weighted gene co-expression networks formed from multiple microarray datasets. The constructed networks approximate scale-free topology, but this is not universal across all datasets. We show strong positive correlations between gene connectivity within the whole network and gene essentiality as well as gene sequence conservation. We demonstrate the preservation of a modular structure of the networks formed, and demonstrate that, within some of these modules, it is possible to observe a strong correlation between connectivity and essentiality or between connectivity and conservation within the modules particularly within modules containing larger numbers of essential genes. CONCLUSION: Application of these techniques can allow a finer scale prediction of relative gene importance for a particular process within a group of similarly expressed genes.},

title = {Somatic mosaicism in neuronal precursor cells mediated by L1 retrotransposition},
abstract = {Revealing the mechanisms for neuronal somatic diversification remains a central challenge for understanding individual differences in brain organization and function. Here we show that an engineered human LINE-1 (for long interspersed nuclear element-1; also known as L1) element can retrotranspose in neuronal precursors derived from rat hippocampus neural stem cells. The resulting retrotransposition events can alter the expression of neuronal genes, which, in turn, can influence neuronal cell fate in vitro. We further show that retrotransposition of a human L1 in transgenic mice results in neuronal somatic mosaicism. The molecular mechanism of action is probably mediated through Sox2, because a decrease in Sox2 expression during the early stages of neuronal differentiation is correlated with increases in both L1 transcription and retrotransposition. Our data therefore indicate that neuronal genomes might not be static, but some might be mosaic because of de novo L1 retrotransposition events.},

title = {The effects of molecular noise and size control on variability in the budding yeast cell cycle},
abstract = {Molecular noise in gene expression can generate substantial variability in protein concentration. However, its effect on the precision of a natural eukaryotic circuit such as the control of cell cycle remains unclear. We use single-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled budding yeast to measure times from division to budding (G1) and from budding to the next division. The variability in G1 decreases with the square root of the ploidy through a 1N/2N/4N ploidy series, consistent with simple stochastic models for molecular noise. Also, increasing the gene dosage of G1 cyclins decreases the variability in G1. A new single-cell reporter for cell protein content allows us to determine the contribution to temporal G1 variability of deterministic size control (that is, smaller cells extending G1). Cell size control contributes significantly to G1 variability in daughter cells but not in mother cells. However, even in daughters, size-independent noise is the largest quantitative contributor to G1 variability. Exit of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 from the nucleus partitions G1 into two temporally uncorrelated and functionally distinct steps. The first step, which depends on the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, corresponds to noisy size control that extends G1 in small daughters, but is of negligible duration in mothers. The second step, whose variability decreases with increasing CLN2 gene dosage, is similar in mothers and daughters. This analysis decomposes the regulatory dynamics of the Start transition into two independent modules, a size sensing module and a timing module, each of which is predominantly controlled by a different G1 cyclin.},

title = {Members of the TEAD family of transcription factors regulate the expression of Myf5 in ventral somitic compartments},
abstract = {The transcriptional regulation of the Mrf4/Myf5 locus depends on a multitude of enhancers that, in equilibria with transcription balancing sequences and the promoters, regulate the expression of the two genes throughout embryonic development and in the adult. Transcription in a particular set of muscle progenitors can be driven by the combined outputs of several enhancers that are not able to recapitulate the entire expression pattern in isolation, or by the action of a single enhancer the activity of which in isolation is equivalent to that within the context of the locus. We identified a new enhancer element of this second class, ECR111, which is highly conserved in all vertebrate species and is necessary and sufficient to drive Myf5 expression in ventro-caudal and ventro-rostral somitic compartments in the mouse embryo. EMSA analyses and data obtained from binding-site mutations in transgenic embryos show that a binding site for a TEA Domain (TEAD) transcription factor is essential for the function of this new enhancer, while ChIP assays show that at least two members of the family of transcription factors bind to it in vivo.},

title = {Pitx2 defines alternate pathways acting through MyoD during limb and somitic myogenesis},
abstract = {The MyoD gene is part of the core regulatory network that governs skeletal myogenesis and acts as an essential determinant of the myogenic cell fate. Although generic regulatory networks converging on this gene have been described, the specific mechanisms leading to MyoD expression in muscles of different ontology remain misunderstood. We now show that the homeobox gene Pitx2 is required for initial activation of the MyoD gene in limb muscle precursors through direct binding of Pitx2 to the MyoD core enhancer. Whereas Myf5 and Mrf4 are dispensable for limb muscle progenitor fate, inactivation of Myf5 and Mrf4 in Pitx2 mutants results in a drastic decrease of limb MyoD expression. Thus, Pitx2 and Myf5 define parallel genetic pathways for limb myogenesis. We show a similar dependence on Pitx2 and Myf5(Mrf4) in myotome, where MyoD expression is initially activated by Myf5 and Mrf4. In their absence, MyoD expression is eventually rescued by a Pax3-dependent mechanism. We now provide evidence that Pitx2 contributes to the rescue of MyoD expression and that it acts downstream of Pax3. We thus propose that myogenic differentiation of somite-derived muscle cells relies on two parallel genetic pathways, with the Pitx2 pathway being of primary importance for limb myogenesis but the Myf5 and Mrf4 pathway predominating in myotome. Muscle-specific wiring of regulatory networks composed of similar transcription factors thus underlies development of distinct skeletal muscles.},

title = {Evolution of molecular phenotypes under stabilizing selection},
abstract = {Molecular phenotypes are important links between genomic information and organismic functions, fitness, and evolution. Complex phenotypes, which are also called quantitative traits, often depend on multiple genomic loci. Their evolution builds on genome evolution in a complicated way, which involves selection, genetic drift, mutations and recombination. Here we develop a coarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which decouples from details of the underlying genotypes. We derive approximate evolution equations for the distribution of phenotype values within and across populations. This dynamics covers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination rates, that is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In a fitness landscape with a single optimal phenotype value, the phenotypic diversity within populations and the divergence between populations reach evolutionary equilibria, which describe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium distributions of both quantities analytically and we show that the ratio of mean divergence and diversity depends on the strength of selection in a universal way: it is largely independent of the phenotype's genomic encoding and of the recombination rate. This establishes a new method for the inference of selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome level. We discuss the implications of our findings for the predictability of evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {In recent years, molecular biologists have uncovered a wealth of information about the proteins controlling cell growth and division in eukaryotes. The regulatory system is so complex that it defies understanding by verbal arguments alone. Quantitative tools are necessary to probe reliably into the details of cell cycle control. To this end, we convert hypothetical molecular mechanisms into sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and use standard analytical and numerical methods to study their solutions. First, we present a simple model of the antagonistic interactions between cyclin-dependent kinases and the anaphase promoting complex, which shows how progress through the cell cycle can be thought of as irreversible transitions (Start and Finish) between two stable states (G1 and S-G2-M) of the regulatory system. Then we add new pieces to the "puzzle" until we obtain reasonable models of the control systems in yeast cells, frog eggs, and cultured mammalian cells.},

title = {Eya protein phosphatase activity regulates Six1-Dach-Eya transcriptional effects in mammalian organogenesis},
abstract = {The precise mechanistic relationship between gene activation and repression events is a central question in mammalian organogenesis, as exemplified by the evolutionarily conserved sine oculis (Six), eyes absent (Eya) and dachshund (Dach) network of genetically interacting proteins. Here, we report that Six1 is required for the development of murine kidney, muscle and inner ear, and that it exhibits synergistic genetic interactions with Eya factors. We demonstrate that the Eya family has a protein phosphatase function, and that its enzymatic activity is required for regulating genes encoding growth control and signalling molecules, modulating precursor cell proliferation. The phosphatase function of Eya switches the function of Six1-Dach from repression to activation, causing transcriptional activation through recruitment of co-activators. The gene-specific recruitment of a co-activator with intrinsic phosphatase activity provides a molecular mechanism for activation of specific gene targets, including those regulating precursor cell proliferation and survival in mammalian organogenesis.},

title = {Transcriptional regulation by competing transcription factor modules},
abstract = {Gene regulatory networks lie at the heart of cellular computation. In these networks, intracellular and extracellular signals are integrated by transcription factors, which control the expression of transcription units by binding to cis-regulatory regions on the DNA. The designs of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cis-regulatory regions are usually highly complex. They frequently consist of both repetitive and overlapping transcription factor binding sites. To unravel the design principles of these promoter architectures, we have designed in silico prokaryotic transcriptional logic gates with predefined input-output relations using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting cis-regulatory designs are often composed of modules that consist of tandem arrays of binding sites to which the transcription factors bind cooperatively. Moreover, these modules often overlap with each other, leading to competition between them. Our analysis thus identifies a new signal integration motif that is based upon the interplay between intramodular cooperativity and intermodular competition. We show that this signal integration mechanism drastically enhances the capacity of cis-regulatory domains to integrate signals. Our results provide a possible explanation for the complexity of promoter architectures and could be used for the rational design of synthetic gene circuits.},

abstract = {When the probability of measuring a particular value of some quantity varies inversely as a power of that value, the quantity is said to follow a power law, also known variously as Zipf's law or the Pareto distribution. Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon craters, wars and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.},

Current studies indicate that chromatin is dynamic, with its structure and its histone modifications undergoing global changes during transitions in development and in response to extracellular cues. In addition to DNA methylation and histone modification, ATP-dependent enzymes that remodel chromatin are important controllers of chromatin structure and assembly, and are major contributors to the dynamic nature of chromatin. Evidence is emerging that these chromatin-remodelling enzymes have instructive and programmatic roles during development. Particularly intriguing are the findings that specialized assemblies of ATP-dependent remodellers are essential for establishing and maintaining pluripotent and multipotent states in cells.},

abstract = {Postnatal growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle requires a population of resident myogenic precursors named satellite cells. The transcription factor Pax7 is critical for satellite cell biogenesis and survival and has been also implicated in satellite cell self-renewal; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Previously, we showed that Pax7 overexpression in adult primary myoblasts down-regulates MyoD and prevents myogenin induction, inhibiting myogenesis. We show that Pax7 prevents muscle differentiation independently of its transcriptional activity, affecting MyoD function. Conversely, myogenin directly affects Pax7 expression and may be critical for Pax7 down-regulation in differentiating cells. Our results provide evidence for a cross-inhibitory interaction between Pax7 and members of the muscle regulatory factor family. This could represent an additional mechanism for the control of satellite cell fate decisions resulting in proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal, necessary for skeletal muscle maintenance and repair.},

title = {From DNA sequence to transcriptional behaviour: a quantitative approach},
abstract = {Complex transcriptional behaviours are encoded in the DNA sequences of gene regulatory regions. Advances in our understanding of these behaviours have been recently gained through quantitative models that describe how molecules such as transcription factors and nucleosomes interact with genomic sequences. An emerging view is that every regulatory sequence is associated with a unique binding affinity landscape for each molecule and, consequently, with a unique set of molecule-binding configurations and transcriptional outputs. We present a quantitative framework based on existing methods that unifies these ideas. This framework explains many experimental observations regarding the binding patterns of factors and nucleosomes and the dynamics of transcriptional activation. It can also be used to model more complex phenomena such as transcriptional noise and the evolution of transcriptional regulation.},

In contrast, a network approach provides a powerful representation of the ecological interactions among species and highlights their global interdependence. Understanding how the responses of pairwise interactions scale to entire assemblages remains one of the great challenges that must be met as society faces global ecosystem change.},

abstract = {Satellite cells are situated beneath the basal lamina that surrounds each myofiber and function as myogenic precursors for muscle growth and repair. The source of satellite cell renewal is controversial and has been suggested to be a separate circulating or interstitial stem cell population. Here, we transplant single intact myofibers into radiation-ablated muscles and demonstrate that satellite cells are self-sufficient as a source of regeneration. As few as seven satellite cells associated with one transplanted myofiber can generate over 100 new myofibers containing thousands of myonuclei. Moreover, the transplanted satellite cells vigorously self-renew, expanding in number and repopulating the host muscle with new satellite cells. Following experimental injury, these cells proliferate extensively and regenerate large compact clusters of myofibers. Thus, within a normally stable tissue, the satellite cell exhibits archetypal stem cell properties and is competent to form the basal origin of adult muscle regeneration.},

abstract = {Precise regulation of gene expression is crucial to myogenesis and is thought to require the cooperation of various transcription factors. On the basis of a bioinformatic analysis of gene regulatory sequences, we hypothesized that myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), key regulators of skeletal myogenesis, cooperate with members of the SIX family of transcription factors, known to play important roles during embryonic skeletal myogenesis. To this day little is known regarding the exact molecular mechanism by which SIX factors regulate muscle development. We have conducted a functional genomic study of the role played by SIX1 and SIX4 during the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts, a model of adult muscle regeneration. We report that SIX factors cooperate with the members of the MRF family to activate gene expression during myogenic differentiation, and that their function is essential to this process. Our findings also support a model where SIX factors function not only 'upstream' of the MRFs during embryogenesis, but also 'in parallel' to them during myoblast differentiation. We have identified new essential nodes that depend on SIX factor function, in the myogenesis regulatory network, and have uncovered a novel way by which MRF function is modulated during differentiation.},

abstract = {The development and differentiation of distinct cell types is achieved through the sequential expression of subsets of genes; yet, the molecular mechanisms that temporally pattern gene expression remain largely unknown. In skeletal myogenesis, gene expression is initiated by MyoD and includes the expression of specific Mef2 isoforms and activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Here, we show that p38 activity facilitates MyoD and Mef2 binding at a subset of late-activated promoters, and the binding of Mef2D recruits Pol II. Most importantly, expression of late-activated genes can be shifted to the early stages of differentiation by precocious activation of p38 and expression of Mef2D, demonstrating that a MyoD-mediated feed-forward circuit temporally patterns gene expression.},

title = {Analysis of mammalian gene batteries reveals both stable ancestral cores and highly dynamic regulatory sequences},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in gene regulation are suspected to comprise one of the driving forces for evolution. To address the extent of cis-regulatory changes and how they impact on gene regulatory networks across eukaryotes, we systematically analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of target gene batteries controlled by 16 different transcription factors. RESULTS: We found that gene batteries show variable conservation within vertebrates, with slow and fast evolving modules. Hence, while a key gene battery associated with the cell cycle is conserved throughout metazoans, the POU5F1 (Oct4) and SOX2 batteries in embryonic stem cells show strong conservation within mammals, with the striking exception of rodents. Within the genes composing a given gene battery, we could identify a conserved core that likely reflects the ancestral function of the corresponding transcription factor. Interestingly, we show that the association between a transcription factor and its target genes is conserved even when we exclude conserved sequence similarities of their promoter regions from our analysis. This supports the idea that turnover, either of the transcription factor binding site or its direct neighboring sequence, is a pervasive feature of proximal regulatory sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the dynamics of evolutionary changes within metazoan gene networks, including both the composition of gene batteries and the architecture of target gene promoters. This variation provides the playground required for evolutionary innovation around conserved ancestral core functions.},

title = {MICRORNA-378 targets the myogenic repressor myor during myoblast differentiation},
abstract = {MicroRNAs play important roles in many cell processes including the differentiation process in several different lineages. For example, microRNAs can promote differentiation by repressing negative regulators of transcriptional activity. These regulated transcription factors can further upregulate levels of the miRNA in a feed forward mechanism. Here we show that MyoD upregulates miR-378 during myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. ChIP-seq analysis shows that MyoD binds in close proximity to the miR-378 gene and causes both transactivation and chromatin remodeling. Overexpression of miR-378 increases the transcriptional activity of MyoD, in part by repressing an antagonist, MyoR. The 3-prime UTR of MyoR contains a direct binding site for miR-378. The presence of this binding site significantly reduces the ability of MyoR to prevent the MyoD driven transdifferentiation of fibroblasts. MyoR and miR-378 were anticorrelated during cardiotoxin induced adult muscle regeneration in mice. Taken together, this shows a feed-forward loop where MyoD indirectly downregulates MyoR via miR-378.},

Beginning with a small list of CRMs mediating a common gene expression pattern, we search genome-wide for CRMs with similar functionality, using new statistical scores and without requiring known motifs or accurate motif discovery. We cross-validate our predictions on 31 regulatory networks in Drosophila and through correlations with gene expression data. Five predicted modules tested using an in vivo reporter gene assay all show tissue-specific regulatory activity. We also demonstrate our methods' ability to predict mammalian tissue-specific enhancers. Finally, we predict human CRMs that regulate early blood and cardiovascular development. In vivo transgenic mouse analysis of two predicted CRMs demonstrates that both have appropriate enhancer activity. Overall, 7/7 predictions were validated successfully in vivo, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for insect and mammalian genomes.},

Available methods for the reverse engineering of such networks from genome-wide expression profiles have been successful only in the analysis of lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Using a new method called ARACNe (algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular networks), we report the reconstruction of regulatory networks from expression profiles of human B cells. The results are suggestive a hierarchical, scale-free network, where a few highly interconnected genes (hubs) account for most of the interactions. Validation of the network against available data led to the identification of MYC as a major hub, which controls a network comprising known target genes as well as new ones, which were biochemically validated. The newly identified MYC targets include some major hubs. This approach can be generally useful for the analysis of normal and pathologic networks in mammalian cells.},

title = {Reprogramming transcription by distinct classes of enhancers functionally defined by eRNA},
abstract = {Mammalian genomes are populated with thousands of transcriptional enhancers that orchestrate cell-type-specific gene expression programs, but how those enhancers are exploited to institute alternative, signal-dependent transcriptional responses remains poorly understood. Here we present evidence that cell-lineage-specific factors, such as FoxA1, can simultaneously facilitate and restrict key regulated transcription factors, exemplified by the androgen receptor (AR), to act on structurally and functionally distinct classes of enhancer. Consequently, FoxA1 downregulation, an unfavourable prognostic sign in certain advanced prostate tumours, triggers dramatic reprogramming of the hormonal response by causing a massive switch in AR binding to a distinct cohort of pre-established enhancers. These enhancers are functional, as evidenced by the production of enhancer-templated non-coding RNA (eRNA) based on global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) analysis, with a unique class apparently requiring no nucleosome remodelling to induce specific enhancer-promoter looping and gene activation. GRO-seq data also suggest that liganded AR induces both transcription initiation and elongation. Together, these findings reveal a large repository of active enhancers that can be dynamically tuned to elicit alternative gene expression programs, which may underlie many sequential gene expression events in development, cell differentiation and disease progression.},

To gain insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks in embryonic stem (ES) cells, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map the locations of 13 sequence-specific TFs (Nanog, Oct4, STAT3, Smad1, Sox2, Zfx, c-Myc, n-Myc, Klf4, Esrrb, Tcfcp2l1, E2f1, and CTCF) and 2 transcription regulators (p300 and Suz12). These factors are known to play different roles in ES-cell biology as components of the LIF and BMP signaling pathways, self-renewal regulators, and key reprogramming factors. Our study provides insights into the integration of the signaling pathways into the ES-cell-specific transcription circuitries. Intriguingly, we find specific genomic regions extensively targeted by different TFs. Collectively, the comprehensive mapping of TF-binding sites identifies important features of the transcriptional regulatory networks that define ES-cell identity.},

abstract = {The relationship between rates of genomic evolution and organismal adaptation remains uncertain, despite considerable interest. The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.},

abstract = {Translational control is a key genetic regulatory mechanism implicated in regulation of cell and organismal growth and early embryonic development. Initiation at the mRNA 5' cap structure recognition step is frequently targeted by translational control mechanisms. In the Drosophila embryo, cap-dependent translation of the uniformly distributed caudal (cad) mRNA is inhibited in the anterior by Bicoid (Bcd) to create an asymmetric distribution of Cad protein. Here, we show that d4EHP, an eIF4E-related cap binding protein, specifically interacts with Bcd to suppress cad translation. Translational inhibition depends on the Bcd binding region (BBR) present in the cad 3' untranslated region. Thus, simultaneous interactions of d4EHP with the cap structure and of Bcd with BBR renders cad mRNA translationally inactive. This example of cap-dependent translational control that is not mediated by canonical eIF4E defines a new paradigm for translational inhibition involving tethering of the mRNA 5' and 3' ends.},

Other data suggest that EBF and E box sites are less important for promoter function at later stages of differentiation, whereas binding sites for Pax-5 (and its Ets ternary complex partners) are required for promoter function in all mb-1-expressing cells. Using DNA microarrays, we found that expression of endogenous mb-1 transcripts correlates most closely with EBF expression and negatively with Id1, an inhibitor of E2A protein function, further linking regulation of the mb-1 gene with EBF and E2A. Together, our studies demonstrate the complexity of factors regulating tissue-specific transcription and support the concept that EBF, E2A, and Pax-5 cooperate to activate target genes in early B-cell development.},

title = {Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development},
abstract = {During development, cells start in a pluripotent state, from which they can differentiate into many cell types, and progressively develop a narrower potential. Their gene-expression programmes become more defined, restricted and, potentially, 'locked in'. Pluripotent stem cells express genes that encode a set of core transcription factors, while genes that are required later in development are repressed by histone marks, which confer short-term, and therefore flexible, epigenetic silencing. By contrast, the methylation of DNA confers long-term epigenetic silencing of particular sequences--transposons, imprinted genes and pluripotency-associated genes--in somatic cells. Long-term silencing can be reprogrammed by demethylation of DNA, and this process might involve DNA repair. It is not known whether any of the epigenetic marks has a primary role in determining cell and lineage commitment during development.},

title = {Autoinhibition with transcriptional delay: a simple mechanism for the zebrafish somitogenesis oscillator},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pattern of somites is traced out by a mechanism involving oscillating gene expression at the tail end of the embryo. In zebrafish, two linked oscillating genes, her1 and her7, coding for inhibitory gene regulatory proteins, are especially implicated in genesis of the oscillations, while Notch signaling appears necessary for synchronization of adjacent cells.

RESULTS: I show by mathematical simulation that direct autorepression of her1 and her7 by their own protein products provides a mechanism for the intracellular oscillator. This mechanism operates robustly even when one allows for the fact that gene regulation is an essentially noisy (stochastic) process. The predicted period is close to the observed period (30 min) and is dictated primarily by the transcriptional delay, the time taken to make an mRNA molecule. Through its coupling to her1/her7 expression, Notch signaling can keep the rapid oscillations in adjacent cells synchronized. When the coupling parameters are varied, however, the model system can switch to oscillations of a much longer period, resembling that of the mouse or chick somitogenesis oscillator and governed by the delays in the Notch pathway. Such Notch-mediated synchronous oscillations are predicted even in the absence of direct her1/her7 autoregulation, through operation of the standard Notch signaling pathway that is usually assumed simply to give lateral inhibition.

CONCLUSIONS: Direct autorepression of a gene by its own product can generate oscillations, with a period determined by the transcriptional and translational delays. Simple as they are, such systems show surprising behaviors. To understand them, unaided intuition is not enough: we need mathematics.},

abstract = {Chromosomes are divided into domains of open chromatin, where genes have the potential to be expressed, and domains of closed chromatin, where genes are not expressed. Classic examples of open chromatin domains include 'puffs' on polytene chromosomes in Drosophila and extended loops from lampbrush chromosomes. If multiple genes were typically expressed together from a single open chromatin domain, the position of co-expressed genes along the chromosomes would appear clustered. To investigate whether co-expressed genes are clustered, we examined the chromosomal positions of the genes expressed in the muscle of Caenorhabditis elegans at the first larval stage. Here we show that co-expressed genes in C. elegans are clustered in groups of 2-5 along the chromosomes, suggesting that expression from a chromatin domain can extend over several genes. These observations reveal a higher-order organization of the structure of the genome, in which the order of the genes along the chromosome id correlated with their expression in specific tissues.},

Through comparison with the human genome, we have generated a largely complete catalogue of the genetic differences that have accumulated since the human and chimpanzee species diverged from our common ancestor, constituting approximately thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements. We use this catalogue to explore the magnitude and regional variation of mutational forces shaping these two genomes, and the strength of positive and negative selection acting on their genes. In particular, we find that the patterns of evolution in human and chimpanzee protein-coding genes are highly correlated and dominated by the fixation of neutral and slightly deleterious alleles. We also use the chimpanzee genome as an outgroup to investigate human population genetics and identify signatures of selective sweeps in recent human evolution.},

In the C. elegans postembryonic mesoderm, this subdivision is a result of an asymmetric cell division that leads to the formation of striated body wall muscles and non-muscle coelomocytes. Here we report that the Six homeodomain protein CEH-34 and its cofactor Eyes Absent, EYA-1, function synergistically to promote the non-muscle fate in cells also competent to form muscles. We further show that the asymmetric expression of ceh-34 and eya-1 is regulated by a combination of 1) mesodermal intrinsic factors MAB-5, HLH-1 and FOZI-1, 2) differential POP-1 (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activity along the anterior-posterior axis, and 3) coelomocyte competence factor(s). These factors are conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates, suggesting a conserved paradigm for mesoderm development in metazoans.},

To gain a more complete understanding of the regulatory network that maintains this state, we identified target promoters of nine transcription factors, including somatic cell reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) and others (Nanog, Dax1, Rex1, Zpf281, and Nac1), on a global scale in mouse ES cells. We found that target genes fall into two classes: promoters bound by few factors tend to be inactive or repressed, whereas promoters bound by more than four factors are largely active in the pluripotent state and become repressed upon differentiation. Furthermore, we propose a transcriptional hierarchy for reprogramming factors and broadly distinguish targets of c-Myc versus other factors. Our data provide a resource for exploration of the complex network maintaining pluripotency.},

We have shown that successive Hox gene activation in the mouse embryo is closely associated with a directional transition in chromatin status, as judged by the dynamic progression of transcription-competent modifications: Increases in activation marks correspond to decreases in repressive marks. Furthermore, using a mouse in which a Hox cluster was split into two pieces, we document the necessity to maintain a clustered organization to properly implement this process. These results suggest that chromatin modifications are important parameters in the temporal regulation of this gene family.},
