	Abstract = {The Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org) provides genome resources for chordate genomes with a particular focus on human genome data as well as data for key model organisms such as mouse, rat and zebrafish. Five additional species were added in the last year including gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys) and Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) bringing the total number of supported species to 61 as of Ensembl release 64 (September 2011). Of these, 55 species appear on the main Ensembl website and six species are provided on the Ensembl preview site (Pre!Ensembl; http://pre.ensembl.org) with preliminary support. The past year has also seen improvements across the project.},

	Abstract = {The field of regulatory genomics today is characterized by the generation of high-throughput data sets that capture genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding, histone modifications, or DNAseI hypersensitive regions across many cell types and conditions. In this context, a critical question is how to make optimal use of these publicly available datasets when studying transcriptional regulation. Here, we address this question in Drosophila melanogaster for which a large number of high-throughput regulatory datasets are available. We developed i-cisTarget (where the 'i' stands for integrative), for the first time enabling the discovery of different types of enriched 'regulatory features' in a set of co-regulated sequences in one analysis, being either TF motifs or 'in vivo' chromatin features, or combinations thereof. We have validated our approach on 15 co-expressed gene sets, 21 ChIP data sets, 628 curated gene sets and multiple individual case studies, and show that meaningful regulatory features can be confidently discovered; that bona fide enhancers can be identified, both by in vivo events and by TF motifs; and that combinations of in vivo events and TF motifs further increase the performance of enhancer prediction.},

	Abstract = {Radial glia cells function as guide cells for neuronal migration and a source of neural progenitor cells, and play a crucial role for the development of the central nervous system. To date, several signals have been demonstrated to promote the formation of radial glia cells and Notch signaling is one such signal. However, the mechanism of the signaling hierarchy of radial glia developmental cascade promoted by Notch signaling still remains incomplete. Here we show that Notch signaling promotes Xenopus radial glia formation and that the Notch activation is sufficient for radial glia formation prior to neural tube closure. Moreover, we have identified Oct-1 (POU2f1), a POU transcription factor, as a downstream target of Notch signaling by microarray based screen. We demonstrate that the expression of Oct-1 in the brain is regulated by Notch signaling and that Oct-1 is sufficient and necessary for radial glia formation. Together, Oct-1 is a downstream effector of Notch signaling during radial glia formation.},

RESULTS: We develop a computational method that uses Hidden Markov Models and an Expectation Maximization algorithm to detect such modules, given the weight matrices of a set of transcription factors known to work together. Two novel features of our probabilistic model are: (i) correlations between binding sites, known to be required for module activity, are exploited, and (ii) phylogenetic comparisons among sequences from multiple species are made to highlight a regulatory module. The novel features are shown to improve detection of modules, in experiments on synthetic as well as biological data.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical formula for estimating the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site (delta) between two homologous DNA sequences is developed by taking into account unequal rates of substitution among different nucleotide pairs. Although this formula is obtained for the equal-input model of nucleotide substitution, computer simulations have shown that it gives a reasonably good estimate for a wide range of nucleotide substitution patterns as long as delta is equal to or smaller than 1. Furthermore, the frequency of cases to which the formula is inapplicable is much lower than that for other similar methods recently proposed. This point is illustrated using insulin genes. A statistical method for estimating the number of nucleotide changes due to deletion and insertion is also developed. Application of this method to globin gene data indicates that the number of nucleotide changes per site increases with evolutionary time but the pattern of the increase is quite irregular.},

@article{Busser:2012uq,
	Abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers integrate the contributions of multiple classes of transcription factors (TFs) to orchestrate the myriad spatio-temporal gene expression programs that occur during development. A molecular understanding of enhancers with similar activities requires the identification of both their unique and their shared sequence features. To address this problem, we combined phylogenetic profiling with a DNA-based enhancer sequence classifier that analyzes the TF binding sites (TFBSs) governing the transcription of a co-expressed gene set. We first assembled a small number of enhancers that are active in Drosophila melanogaster muscle founder cells (FCs) and other mesodermal cell types. Using phylogenetic profiling, we increased the number of enhancers by incorporating orthologous but divergent sequences from other Drosophila species. Functional assays revealed that the diverged enhancer orthologs were active in largely similar patterns as their D. melanogaster counterparts, although there was extensive evolutionary shuffling of known TFBSs. We then built and trained a classifier using this enhancer set and identified additional related enhancers based on the presence or absence of known and putative TFBSs. Predicted FC enhancers were over-represented in proximity to known FC genes; and many of the TFBSs learned by the classifier were found to be critical for enhancer activity, including POU homeodomain, Myb, Ets, Forkhead, and T-box motifs. Empirical testing also revealed that the T-box TF encoded by org-1 is a previously uncharacterized regulator of muscle cell identity. Finally, we found extensive diversity in the composition of TFBSs within known FC enhancers, suggesting that motif combinatorics plays an essential role in the cellular specificity exhibited by such enhancers. In summary, machine learning combined with evolutionary sequence analysis is useful for recognizing novel TFBSs and for facilitating the identification of cognate TFs that coordinate cell type-specific developmental gene expression patterns.},

	Abstract = {Enhancer function underlies regulatory processes by which cells establish patterns of gene expression. Recent results suggest that many enhancers are specified by particular chromatin marks in pluripotent cells, which may be modified later in development to alter patterns of gene expression and cell differentiation choices. These marks may contribute to the repertoire of epigenetic mechanisms responsible for cellular memory and determine the timing of transcription factor accessibility to the enhancer. Mechanistically, cohesin and non-coding RNAs are emerging as crucial players responsible for facilitating enhancer-promoter interactions at some genes. Surprisingly, these interactions may be required not only to facilitate initiation of transcription but also to activate the release of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from promoter-proximal pausing.},

Here we discuss recent studies that have provided fresh insights on information processing that occurs on enhancers, and propose that in addition to the highly cooperative and coordinate action of "enhanceosomes", a less integrative, but more flexible form of information processing is mediated by information display or "billboard" enhancers. Application of these models has important ramifications not only for the biochemical analysis of transcription, but also for the wider fields of bioinformatics and evolutionary biology.},

	Abstract = {BC1 RNA and BC200 RNA are two non-homologous, small non-messenger RNAs (snmRNAs) that were generated, evolutionarily, quite recently by retroposition. This process endowed the RNA polymerase III transcripts with central adenosine-rich regions. Both RNAs are expressed almost exclusively in neurons, where they are transported into dendritic processes as ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). Here, we demonstrate with a variety of experimental approaches that poly(A)-binding protein (PABP1), a regulator of translation initiation, binds to both RNAs in vitro and in vivo. We identified the association of PABP with BC200 RNA in a tri-hybrid screen and confirmed this binding in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and via anti-PABP immunoprecipitation of BC1 and BC200 RNAs from crude extracts, immunodepleted extracts, partially purified RNPs and cells transfected with naked RNA. Furthermore, PABP immunoreactivity was localized to neuronal dendrites. Competition experiments using variants of BC1 and BC200 RNAs demonstrated that the central adenosine-rich region of both RNAs mediates binding to PABP. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that the BC1 and BC200 RNPs are involved in protein translation in neuronal dendrites.},

	Abstract = {The SMAD (small mother against decapentaplegic) family comprises transcription factors that function as signal transducers of TGFbeta (transforming growth factor) superfamily members. The number of studies showing expression, activation or involvement of both SMAD and TGFbeta family members in cardiovascular diseases is constantly rising. In this context, the position of SMADs in the diseased heart is particularly interesting because, besides their well-known fibrotic effects, increasing evidence demonstrates direct action of SMADs on cardiomyocytes as well as on the vascular system. In these systems, SMAD proteins are described to have effects on heart development, cell proliferation, cell growth, and apoptosis. As will be discussed in this review, these different consequences of SMAD activation are dependent on different SMAD isoforms, interaction of SMAD with other transcription factors in the particular situation, and modulation of SMAD activity by various kinases. As a result of all these influences, it turns out that activation of SMAD by members of the BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) family, which is a subfamily of the TGFbeta superfamily, is necessary for correct heart development. On the other hand, activation of SMADs by TGFbeta family members results in fibrotic, apoptotic, and anti-hypertrophic processes that are related to a detrimental cardiac remodeling and progression to heart failure.},

	Abstract = {Combinatorial interactions between cis elements and trans-acting factors are required for regulation of cardiac gene expression during normal cardiac development and pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Sp factors bind GC boxes and are implicated in recruitment and assembly of the basal transcriptional complex. In this study, we show that the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter contains a GC box that is necessary for basal and cAMP-mediated activity of cTnT promoter constructs transfected in embryonic cardiomyocytes. Cardiac nuclear proteins bind the cTnT GC box in a sequence-specific fashion and consist of Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 protein factors. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, Sp1 binds the cTnT promoter "in vivo." Cotransfected Sp1 trans-activates the cTnT promoter in cardiomyocytes in culture. Sp3 represses Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation of the cTnT gene in embryonic cardiomyocytes. Sp3 repression of Sp1-mediated cTnT promoter activation is dose dependent, inferring a mechanism of competitive binding/inhibition. To evaluate the role of Sp factors in cardiac gene expression in vivo, we have established a clinically relevant animal model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy where the fetal cardiac program is activated. In this animal model, cardiac hypertrophy results from increased left-right shunting, volume loading of the left ventricle, and pressure loading of the right ventricle. Sp1 expression is increased in all four hypertrophied cardiac chambers, whereas Sp3 expression is diminished. This observation is consistent with the in vitro activating function of Sp1 and inhibitory effects of Sp3 on activity of cTnT promoter constructs. Sp factor levels are modulated during the hypertrophic cardiac program in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The rabbit cardiac/slow twitch muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2) gene encodes a Ca2+ transport pump whose expression is regulated during skeletal and cardiac muscle development and in response to various pathophysiological and hormonal states. Employing transient transfection analyses in Sol8 muscle cells, we have identified two positive regulatory regions, one distal (-1810 base pair (bp) to -1110 bp) and one proximal (-284 bp to -72 bp), within the SERCA2 promoter. The proximal promoter region from -284 bp to -80 bp was shown to confer muscle-specific expression to a heterologous promoter in Sol8 cells. This region is highly GC-rich containing the consensus sequence for four Sp1 elements (GGGCGG) and three Sp1-like elements (GGGAGG). DNase I footprint analysis with Sol8 nuclear extracts and purified Sp1 protein showed the protection of the seven Sp1 binding sites. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of the Sp1 consensus sites demonstrated that Sp1 sites are essential for the muscle-specific expression of the SERCA2 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cotransfection of an Sp1 expression vector together with SERCA2-CAT constructs can up-regulate SERCA2 promoter activity. These results imply that the Sp1 transcription factor plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of SERCA2 within muscle cells.},

By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.},

We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function.},

The data display sharp resolution of binding position [+/-50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area >/= 0.96] and statistical confidence (P <10(-4)), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions.

A generalized least-squares method was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 10.9 +/- 1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the pipedal creature Australopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that mtDNA was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.},

	Abstract = {The laboratory mouse is the most widely used mammalian model organism in biomedical research. The 2.6 × 10(9) bases of the mouse genome possess a high degree of conservation with the human genome, so a thorough annotation of the mouse genome will be of significant value to understanding the function of the human genome. So far, most of the functional sequences in the mouse genome have yet to be found, and the cis-regulatory sequences in particular are still poorly annotated. Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for the discovery of these sequences, but on its own it cannot resolve their temporal and spatial functions. Recently, ChIP-Seq has been developed to identify cis-regulatory elements in the genomes of several organisms including humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we apply the same experimental approach to a diverse set of 19 tissues and cell types in the mouse to produce a map of nearly 300,000 murine cis-regulatory sequences. The annotated sequences add up to 11% of the mouse genome, and include more than 70% of conserved non-coding sequences. We define tissue-specific enhancers and identify potential transcription factors regulating gene expression in each tissue or cell type. Finally, we show that much of the mouse genome is organized into domains of coordinately regulated enhancers and promoters. Our results provide a resource for the annotation of functional elements in the mammalian genome and for the study of mechanisms regulating tissue-specific gene expression.},

While it has been shown that the cells of the conduction system are derived from myocytes, additional cell types, including neural crest cells, may play a role in the development and maturation of these specialized cell lineages. Previous work has shown that the expression of the hf-1b gene is required for specification of the cardiac conduction system. Using Cre-Lox technology, we conditionally mutated the hf-1b gene in the ventricular and the neural crest cell lineages. Cx40 immunohistochemistry on HF-1b tissue-restricted knockouts revealed a requirement for HF-1b in the cardiomyogenic lineage. Electrophysiological studies identified a second requirement for HF-1b in the neural crest-derived cells. Absence of HF-1b in the neural crest led to atrial and atrioventricular dysfunction resulting from deficiencies in the neurotrophin receptor trkC. Therefore, in this study, we document that a single transcription factor, HF-1b, acts through two separate cell types to direct distinct functions of the cardiac conduction system.},

	Abstract = {A single nucleotide substitution in intron 3 of IGF2 in pigs abrogates a binding site for a repressor and leads to a 3-fold up-regulation of IGF2 in skeletal muscle. The mutation has major effects on muscle growth, size of the heart, and fat deposition. Here, we have identified the repressor and find that the protein, named ZBED6, is previously unknown, specific for placental mammals, and derived from an exapted DNA transposon. Silencing of Zbed6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts affected Igf2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing using C2C12 cells identified about 2,500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, and the deduced consensus motif gave a perfect match with the established binding site in Igf2. Genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites showed a highly significant enrichment for certain Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. The phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED6-silenced C2C12 myoblasts, the extreme sequence conservation, its nucleolar localization, the broad tissue distribution, and the many target genes with essential biological functions suggest that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth.},

	Abstract = {Cell specification and differentiation of cardiomyocytes from mesodermal precursors is orchestrated by epigenetic and transcriptional inputs throughout heart formation. Of the many transcription factor super families that play a role in this process, the basic Helix-loop Helix (bHLH) family of proteins is well represented. The bHLH protein by design allows for dimerization-both as homodimers and heterodimers with other proteins within the family. Although DNA binding is mediated via a short variable cis-element termed an E-box, it is clear that DNA-affinity for these elements as well as the transcriptional input conveyed is dictated largely by the transcriptional partners within the dimer complex. Dimer partner choice has a number of inputs requiring co-expression within a given cell nucleus and dimerization modulation by the level of protein present, and post-translational modifications that can both enhance or reduce protein-protein interactions. Due to these complex interrelationships, it has been difficult to identity bona-fide downstream transcriptional targets and define the molecular pathways regulated of bHLH factors within cardiogenesis, despite the clear roles suggested via loss-of-function animals models. This review focuses on the Hand bHLH proteins-key members of the Twist-family of bHLH factors. Despite over a decade of investigation, questions regarding functional redundancy, downstream targets, and biological role during heart specification and differentiation have still not been fully addressed. Our goal is to review what is currently known and address strategies for gaining further understanding of Hand/Twist gene dosage and functional redundancy relationships within the developing heart that may underlie congenital heart defect pathogenesis.},

Over the past years, the function and regulation of these genes have been addressed using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in chick and mice. The use of multiple mutations either in cis-configuration in trans-configuration or in cis/trans configurations, has confirmed that Hox genes are essential for proper limb development, where they participate in both the growth and organization of the structures. Even though their molecular mechanisms of action remain somewhat elusive, the results of these extensive genetic analyses confirm that, during the development of the limbs, the various axes cannot be considered in isolation from each other and that a more holistic view of limb development should prevail over a simple cartesian, chess grid-like approach of these complex structures. With this in mind, the functional input of Hox genes during limb growth and development can now be re-assessed.},

	Abstract = {The pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cell line P19 can differentiate in vitro into neurons and astrocytes. By employing this neural cell differentiation system, we have studied the expression and function of a POU transcription factor implicated in mammalian neurogenesis. When P19 cells differentiated to the neural cells, one of the CNS-specific POU genes (Brn-2) was selectively induced. The induction of Brn-2 was specific to the neural cell lineages and took place at the early stage of differentiation. When the Brn-2 induction was blocked/delayed by antisense RNA, such cells were unable to differentiate to neurons and astrocytes. Instead they differentiated to nonneural cells, including smooth and skeletal muscle cells. Furthermore, with reduced levels of antisense RNA, differentiation to neural cells occurred. These results indicate that Brn-2 is essential for the neural cell differentiation of P19 cells and suggest that Brn-2 is one of the genes required for establishing neural cell lineages in mammals.},

Lhx3 is involved in the generation of two adjacent, but distinct, cell types for locomotion, motor neurons and V2 interneurons. Using in vivo function and protein interaction assays, we found that Lhx3 binds directly to the LIM cofactor NLI to trigger V2 interneuron differentiation. In motor neurons, however, Isl1 is available to compete for binding to NLI, displacing Lhx3 to a high-affinity binding site on the C-terminal region of Isl1 and thereby transforming Lhx3 from an interneuron-promoting factor to a motor neuron-promoting factor. This switching mechanism enables specific LIM complexes to form in each cell type and ensures that neuronal fates are tightly segregated.},

Current modeling of selection via site-to-site rate heterogeneity generally neglects another aspect of selection, namely position-specific amino acid frequencies. These frequencies determine the maximum dissimilarity expected for highly diverged but functionally and structurally conserved sequences, and hence are crucial for estimating long distances. We introduce a codon-level model of coding sequence evolution in which position-specific amino acid frequencies are free parameters. In our implementation, these are estimated from an alignment using methods described previously. We use simulations to demonstrate the importance and feasibility of modeling such behavior; our model produces linear distance estimates over a wide range of distances, while several alternative models underestimate long distances relative to short distances. Site-to-site differences in rates, as well as synonymous/nonsynonymous and first/second/third-codon-position differences, arise as a natural consequence of the site-to-site differences in amino acid frequencies.},

	Abstract = {Characterization of the evolutionary constraints acting on cis-regulatory sequences is crucial to comparative genomics and provides key insights on the evolution of organismal diversity. We study the relationships among orthologous cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in 12 Drosophila species, especially with respect to the evolution of transcription factor binding sites, and report statistical evidence in favor of key evolutionary hypotheses. Binding sites are found to have position-specific substitution rates. However, the selective forces at different positions of a site do not act independently, and the evidence suggests that constraints on sites are often based on their exact binding affinities. Binding site loss is seen to conform to a molecular clock hypothesis. The rate of site loss is transcription factor-specific and depends on the strength of binding and, in some cases, the presence of other binding sites in close proximity. Our analysis is based on a novel computational method for aligning orthologous CRMs on a tree, which rigorously accounts for alignment uncertainties and exploits binding site predictions through a unified probabilistic framework. Finally, we report weak purifying selection on short deletions, providing important clues about overall spatial constraints on CRMs. Our results present a complex picture of regulatory sequence evolution, with substantial plasticity that depends on a number of factors. The insights gained in this study will help us to understand the combinatorial control of gene regulation and how it evolves. They will pave the way for theoretical models that are cognizant of the important determinants of regulatory sequence evolution and will be critical in genome-wide identification of non-coding sequences under purifying or positive selection.},

In addition, Lef1(-/-)Tcf1(-/-) embryos have defects in the formation of the placenta and in the development of limb buds, which fail both to express Fgf8 and to form an apical ectodermal ridge.

Here, we examine in detail the structure and function of sparkling, a Notch- and EGFR/MAPK-regulated, cone cell-specific enhancer of the Drosophila Pax2 gene, in vivo. In addition to its 12 previously identified protein-binding sites, sparkling is densely populated with previously unmapped regulatory sequences, which interact in complex ways to control gene expression. One segment is essential for activation at a distance, yet dispensable for other activation functions and for cell type patterning. Unexpectedly, rearranging sparkling's regulatory sites converts it into a robust photoreceptor-specific enhancer. Our results show that a single combination of regulatory inputs can encode multiple outputs, and suggest that the enhancer's organization determines the correct expression pattern by facilitating certain short-range regulatory interactions at the expense of others.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression stripes in Drosophila melanogaster embryos provide a model for how eukaryotic promoters are turned on and off in response to combinations of transcriptional regulators. Genetic studies suggested that even-skipped (eve) stripe 2 is controlled by three gap genes, hunchback (hb), Kruppel (Kr), and giant (gt), and by the maternal morphogen bicoid (bcd). A direct link is established between binding sites for these regulatory proteins in the stripe 2 promoter element and the expression of the stripe during early embryogenesis. The bcd and hb protein binding sites mediate activation, whereas neighboring gt and Kr protein sites repress expression and establish the stripe borders. The stripe 2 element has the properties of a genetic on-off switch.},

	Abstract = {Cancer-specificity is the key requirement for a drug or treatment regimen to be effective against malignant disease--and has rarely been achieved adequately to date. Therefore, targeting strategies need to be implemented for future therapies to ensure efficient activity at the site of patients' tumors or metastases without causing intolerable side-effects. Gene therapy and viral oncolysis represent treatment modalities that offer unique opportunities for tumor targeting. This is because both the transfer of genes with anti-cancer activity and viral replication-induced cell killing, respectively, facilitate the incorporation of multiple mechanisms restricting their activity to cancer. To this end, cellular mechanisms of gene regulation have been successfully exploited to direct therapeutic gene expression and viral cell lysis to cancer cells. Here, transcriptional targeting has been the role model and most widely investigated. This approach exploits cellular gene regulatory elements that mediate cell type-specific transcription to restrict the expression of therapeutic genes or essential viral genes, ideally to cancer cells. In this review, we first discuss the rationale for such promoter targeting and its limitations. We then give an overview how tissue-/tumor-specific promoters are being identified and characterized. Strategies to apply and optimize such promoters for the engineering of targeted viral gene transfer vectors and oncolytic viruses-with respect to promoter size, selectivity and activity in the context of viral genomes-are described. Finally, we discuss in more detail individual examples for transcriptionally targeted virus drugs. First highlighting oncolytic viruses targeted by prostate-specific promoters and by the telomerase promoter as representatives of tissue-targeted and pan-cancer-specific virus drugs respectively, and secondly recent developments of the last two years.},

In this review, we discuss strategies to restrict transcription of transgenes to tumour cells. A range of promoters which are tissue-specific, tumour-specific, or inducible by exogenous agents are presented. Transcriptional targeting should prevent normal tissue toxicities associated with other cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy. In addition, the specificity of these strategies should provide improved targeting of metastatic tumours following systemic gene delivery. Rapid progress in the ability to specifically control transgenes will allow systemic gene delivery for cancer therapy to become a real possibility in the near future.},

	Abstract = {A range of luciferase reporter vectors was constructed, incorporating 5'-flanking sequences from the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), human glandular kallikrein 2 (hKLK2), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters for expression control. Tissue specificity was evaluated in the PSA-positive line LNCaP and PSA-negative cells from different tissues of origin (CoLo320, DG75, EJ, A2780, and Jurkat). The minimal 628-bp PSA and hKLK2 promoters showed only low-level expression in either PSA-positive or PSA-negative cells and showed no increase with the addition of androgen. Tandem duplication of the PSA promoter slightly increased expression in PSA-positive LNCaP cells. The addition of CMV enhancer sequences upstream of a single PSA or hKLK2 promoter substantially but nonspecifically increased luciferase expression in all cell lines tested. However, placing a 1455-bp PSA enhancer sequence upstream of either the PSA or hKLK2 promoters increased expression 20-fold in the PSA-positive cell line LNCaP but not in the PSA-negative lines. Tandem duplication of the PSA enhancer increased expression to approximately 50-fold higher than either promoter alone while retaining tissue-specific control. The level of expression was reduced by the addition of a third copy of the PSA enhancer. Expression from all enhancer constructs was increased 100-fold above basal levels when induced with the androgen dihydrotestosterone, with the PSA-based constructs consistently exhibiting roughly twice the level of expression of the hKLK2-based constructs at all androgen concentrations. Adenovirus vectors were produced in which either enhanced green fluorescent protein or nitroreductase could be expressed from the optimized PSA double enhancer-promoter construct and evaluated in LNCaP cells and the bladder-derived line EJ. Control vectors with the CMV promoter gave good levels of expression in both cell lines, whereas the PSA constructs only produced detectable levels of protein in the LNCaP cells as assessed by fluorescence of enhanced green fluorescent protein or by Western blotting of nitroreductase. LNCaP but not EJ cells were selectively sensitized to the prodrug CB1954 following infection with Ad-PSA(EEP)-NR. The PSA-based nitroreductase virus produced comparable amounts of nitroreductase and sensitization to CB1954 approaching that of the CMV-driven virus. Plasmid and adenovirus constructs combining PSA enhancer and promoter sequences demonstrate selective expression of linked genes in PSA-positive cells. The expression is induced by androgen and gives therapeutically relevant levels of effector proteins.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylogenetic footprinting has revealed that cis-regulatory enhancers consist of conserved DNA sequence clusters (CSCs). Currently, there is no systematic approach for enhancer discovery and analysis that takes full-advantage of the sequence information within enhancer CSCs.
RESULTS: We have generated a Drosophila genome-wide database of conserved DNA consisting of >100,000 CSCs derived from EvoPrints spanning over 90% of the genome. cis-Decoder database search and alignment algorithms enable the discovery of functionally related enhancers. The program first identifies conserved repeat elements within an input enhancer and then searches the database for CSCs that score highly against the input CSC. Scoring is based on shared repeats as well as uniquely shared matches, and includes measures of the balance of shared elements, a diagnostic that has proven to be useful in predicting cis-regulatory function. To demonstrate the utility of these tools, a temporally-restricted CNS neuroblast enhancer was used to identify other functionally related enhancers and analyze their structural organization.
CONCLUSIONS: cis-Decoder reveals that co-regulating enhancers consist of combinations of overlapping shared sequence elements, providing insights into the mode of integration of multiple regulating transcription factors. The database and accompanying algorithms should prove useful in the discovery and analysis of enhancers involved in any developmental process.},

We found these cells to not be present in substantial numbers in the CNS until after embryonic day (E) 10.5 in mouse and E5 in chick. This coincides with the induction of SOX9 in neural cells. Gain- and loss-of-function studies indicated that SOX9 was essential for multipotent NSC formation. Moreover, Sonic Hedgehog was able to stimulate precocious generation of NSCs by inducing Sox9 expression. SOX9 was also necessary for the maintenance of multipotent NSCs, as shown by in vivo fate mapping experiments in the adult subependymal zone and olfactory bulbs. In addition, loss of SOX9 led ependymal cells to adopt a neuroblast identity. These data identify a functional link between extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of NSCs specification and maintenance, and establish a central role for SOX9 in the process.},

Distant-acting transcriptional enhancers are particularly challenging to uncover because they are scattered among the vast non-coding portion of the genome. Evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate the discovery of enhancers, but fails to predict when and where they are active in vivo. Here we present the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation with the enhancer-associated protein p300 followed by massively parallel sequencing, and map several thousand in vivo binding sites of p300 in mouse embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue. We tested 86 of these sequences in a transgenic mouse assay, which in nearly all cases demonstrated reproducible enhancer activity in the tissues that were predicted by p300 binding. Our results indicate that in vivo mapping of p300 binding is a highly accurate means for identifying enhancers and their associated activities, and suggest that such data sets will be useful to study the role of tissue-specific enhancers in human biology and disease on a genome-wide scale.},

	Abstract = {Cell fate determination depends in part on the establishment of specific transcriptional programs of gene expression. These programs result from the interpretation of the genomic cis-regulatory information by sequence-specific factors. Decoding this information in sequenced genomes is an important issue. Here, we developed statistical analysis tools to computationally identify the cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression in a set of coregulated genes. Starting with a small number of validated and/or predicted cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a reference species as a training set, but with no a priori knowledge of the factors acting in trans, we computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and genomic CRMs underlying coregulation. This method was applied to the gene expression program active in Drosophila melanogaster sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs), a specific type of neural progenitor cells. Mutational analysis showed that four, including one newly characterized, out of the five top-ranked families of predicted TFBSs were required for SOP-specific gene expression. Additionaly, 19 out of the 29 top-ranked predicted CRMs directed gene expression in neural progenitor cells, i.e., SOPs or larval brain neuroblasts, with a notable fraction active in SOPs (11/29). We further identified the lola gene as the target of two SOP-specific CRMs and found that the lola gene contributed to SOP specification. The statistics and phylogeny-based tools described here can be more generally applied to identify the cis-regulatory elements of specific gene regulatory networks in any family of related species with sequenced genomes.},
